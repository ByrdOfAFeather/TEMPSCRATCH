We still have parchment manuscripts from late antiquity that have survived intact, and more may yet turn up. \\n That said, the Romans did leave behind quite a bit of documentary evidence.

I'm not sure, its been a while. \\n TL,DR: Literature suggesting evidence of Jesus and who He was. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"This isn't entirely accurate.

Pronouns, for example.  Also, the reason Modern English has so few declensions is directly due to the influence of Old Norse. \\n TLDR: Old Norse is still very much with us. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('That\\'s a good question. Part of me wants to say that it helped keep France out of the Soviet sphere of influence, but then again, there\\'s no telling if Germany would\\'ve surrendered with the fall of Berlin. Resistance cells would\\'ve likely risen up and pushed the remaining troops out of France, given that Germany would\\'ve been able to pull more troops out of France to stem the tide of the Russians. \\n It\\'s also possible that there would be two separate states, the \"Free France\" state and the Vichy State, because said resistance cells (now turned into a formal militia) may not have been able to overtake those French troops...I\\'m going to just stop here because this isn\\'t /r/HistoricalWhatIf and there\\'s no need for further speculation. \\n Tl;dr: We will never know because of the massive impact it had in \"saving\" BeNeLux, Denmark, and Italy; there are too many variables to take into account. \\n',\n  0),\n ('In an ideal world, you would command a surprising number of languages.  Attic/Koine/Byzantine/Modern Greek, Latin, French, German, Russian, Ottoman/Modern Turkish, and Arabic. (maybe Persian and Coptic?) \\n But as /u/emilytried mentioned, all aren\\'t of equal importance and are dependent upon what era you\\'re choosing to focus on. \\n As a baseline, you need to know Greek.  But unfortunately, Greek from Attic to Modern is almost as wide a variance as from Latin to Standard Italian, especially since they roughly cover the same time frame. \\n Though you\\'d think that since you\\'re studying the Byzantine era you\\'d want to learn Byzantine Greek, a lot of Byzantine documents are written with an eye on emulating either Attic or Koine Greek for prestige purposes.  Procopius is a Byzantine historian writing in Attic that comes to mind.  Also the resources for studying specifically Byzantine Greek are far less than for the other three.  For that reason alone, I would recommend learning Koine Greek, as it\\'s a bridge between Attic and Byzantine, and given that it\\'s the language of the church, would be helpful in reading religious texts and their particular vocabulary. \\n After Koine Greek, I\\'d recommend learning French and German.  This is in fact standard in the academic community, as most scholarship if it\\'s not generated in english, will be in French or German, reflecting the three languages of the most prestigious and best funded universities in the world. \\n These three, Koine Greek, German, and French are the most essential for starting building blocks.  The other languages are for depending upon which era you want to focus on. \\n If you\\'re dealing with the Early Byzantine/Late Roman era (285-630), then Latin is also required, as there was still a lot of administration done in that language, and you\\'d have to have a solid command of it.  Outside of Latin, maybe Coptic and Persian to deal with Byzantine Egypt and Sassanid Persia. \\n If you\\'re dealing with the Middle Byzantine era (630 - 1025), then I\\'d recommend adding Arabic, as so much of that era is defined by Byzantine/Caliphate interactions.  And for interactions with the west, you don\\'t need to know Latin quite as much as you can deal with secondary sources written in English, German or French on those subjects, as by then the language of Byzantine administration is all in Greek, unlike in the early era.  I\\'d also make a pitch for adding Russian to the mix, as the middle Byzantine era is when a lot of the Slavic polities really began to come into sharp focus in their conflict with Byzantium, however current Russian/Slavic research isn\\'t \"quite\" as robust these days as English/German/French into this era. \\n Lastly for the late Byzantine era (1025 - 1453), Ottoman/Modern Turkish will be of a massive help to study the final fall of the empire.  There\\'s actually a lot of good research and archaeology being generated out of Turkey on the Byzantine Empire of all eras that simply isn\\'t being read because of the inability for most non-specialist scholars to read turkish.  If you truly want to stand out in Byzantine study, I\\'d recommend tackling this language. \\n So tl;dr overall, in order of my recommendation (IMO only the first 4 are really necessary): \\n \\n English (duh) \\n Koine Greek \\n French \\n German \\n Modern Turkish \\n Russian \\n Arabic \\n Latin \\n All others (Ottoman Turkish, Persian, Coptic, other Greek) \\n \\n',\n  0),\n (\"Yes and no. \\n The puplished plans for an attack, which where optained by Western powers after 1989, did include very specific, and agressive plans for an invasion of Western Europe. Even printed, congratulatory letters, to the Eastern European leaders, expressing the USSR's great apreciation for their victory, in their respective sectors of the European war-theatre. \\n The initiation of theese plans where always thought to be a, genuine, Western provocation. It is important to remember how the two sides entered the Cold War. USA entered victorius and with the A-bomb, while the USSR entered devastated and with a very real paranoia, that the Western powers would turn on the USSR at any given moment. British plans to use German POWs against the USSR where later revealed, and during the time of American, atomic hegemony, a nuclear-backed invasion was discussed among the military leadership of the USA. The Soviet anexation of Eastern Europe, as well as their paranioa-filled military planning, has to be seen in this light. \\n An asymetric measure of force, compared to what NATO was planning, was evident in the plans of the USSR. If a conflict erupted, NATO planned to fire a nuclear warning shot over the Atlantic, hopefully followed by negosiations. \\nWhere as the USSR planned to nuke the Danish town of Esbjerg, followed by a full occupation of Western Europe, Yugoslavia and Sweden excluded, as their warning shot. Theese shots would have been fired two to three days into a conventional conflict on the European continent. \\nBoth the USA and the USSR knew that an invasion of Europe was a conflict senario that might have escalated into an all out nuclear war, but didn't have to. The USSR planned on using tactical nukes on every Western European port during an invasion. In such a senario, the USA was considered, even by it's NATO allies, to be most likely to abandon Western Europe all togheter. That was one of the greatest driving factors behind Frances' and the UKs' acquisition of their own nuclear devices. \\n Everyone expected the Atlantic sea to be a barier that would weight stronger than NATO. If no nukes crossed it, World War III would have been short. The USA, accepting the loss of Western Europe. There where no such buffer-zone between the Eastern European SSR's and Russia. Had anyone provoced the territorial integrity of the USSR as a whole, the whole of Europe, excluding Sweden and Yugoslavia (possibly Albania to?) would have become SSRs. \\n My sources are primarily a lecture by a former Danish general, who was in service during the eighties and early nineties. With more information gathered at my university, since the former NATO general wasn't too keenly elaborating on anything, but the plans of the USSR. \\n TL;DR: If they where provoced, Yes. Very specific plans existed. Otherwise, no. \\n Edit: ,'s and .'s and words. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('That\\'s a difficult question. As far as I know we don\\'t have much to work with in terms of sources (stuff this old is way out of my league). \\n There\\'s a mention of some kind of war-song in Tacitus\\' Germania: \\n > III \\n > They narrate of Hercules’ erstwhile stay With them and sing to him before the fray To him number one hero among the strong. \\n > They also have many a ‘baritus’ song auguring the impending battle’s fate With notes possessing a rhythmic clout kindling their souls as they’re belted out And according as their bands resonate Scare their foes while they themselves trepidate As more than voices they have the illusion Of hearing of valour the warlike fusion Both harshness and asperity Along with a broken clamour Are sought out particularly With mouths and tongues lambent To the shields of the armour So that harder and louder may boom The reverberating voice of doom \\n Ammianus Marcellinus also mentions something that might have been some kind of war-song war-cry (that the Romans didn\\'t like): \\n > XXXI.7.11 \\n > Therefore when the armies on both sides, advancing more cautiously, at last halted and stood immovable, the warriors, with mutual sternness, surveying each other with fierce looks. The Romans in every part of their line sang warlike songs, with a voice rising from a lower to a higher key, which they call barritus, and so encouraged themselves to gallant exertions. But the barbarians, with dissonant clamour, shouted out the praises of their ancestors, and amid their various discordant cries, tried occasional light skirmishes. \\n Jordanes also talks about music (maybe about the Goths) in his Getica: \\n > V.43 \\n >  They were the first race of men to string the bow with cords, as Lucan, who is more of a historian than a poet, affirms: \"They string Armenian bows with Getic cords.\" In earliest times they sang of the deeds of their ancestors in strains of song accompanied by the cithara; chanting of Eterpamara, Hanala, Fritigern, Vidigoia and others whose fame among them is great; such heroes as admiring antiquity scarce proclaims its own to be. \\n I guess those are not terribly useful to really know about Germanic music... \\n Getting a little closer to the Holy Roman Empire, we find the so called Carolingian Renaissance. By that time, the chant of the Church in Rome was migrating north. \\n Charlemagne invited Albinus of York (an English scholar) around 781 to set up a cathedral school. The curriculum was that of the trivium and quadrivium, this last one including music. Now, by music I mean mostly some ancient Greek theory (which includes the maths to determine musical notes by using ratios and lengths on a taut string). \\n It was decided to unify the liturgy of all the realm (which was quite big). This meant the previous forms of chant (including Gallican chant) had to go. It was not an easy process, and this effort of standardization was significant for the history of music because we see the Western musical notation appearing during/after that process. \\n Do we have any concrete German musical examples from before the HRE? I am not sure. Well, I think it\\'s closer to \"no, not really\" but \"kind of\" if you are not too picky. \\n The  Planctus (de obitu) Karoli . We have music associated with it, but the notation (which is one of the earliest kinds we have) is not from the time the text was written. I cannot tell if the music was composed much later, or if it was communicated via oral tradition and then notated. In any case, [here\\'s a video]( Compare the previous recording to [this one]( or even to [this other]( \\n That notation is very problematic. You see the text, and then some neumes (dots and squiggles) above it. Those are not very specific... Be very sceptic about recordings of this sort of music. Yes, a lot of knowledgeable people have worked hard to get an idea of what all that sounded like, but the information we have is very limited. Some speculation is needed to attempt to recreate pretty much all music earlier than the 19th century, attempting to recreate music from neumes obviously requires MUCH more. \\n We have every reason to believe there was non-liturgical, non-religious music, and that there could be music with more instruments than the voice (with more instruments playing at once, too). However, I don\\'t know of any surviving example of such music. \\n TL;DR \\n As with most music from so long ago, not terribly much. You are asking about something that is kind of prehistoric, because Western musical notation started to develop about the time limit you set. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"Marius' reforms did do away with the original unit 'classes'. (for want of a better word) \\n In the Roman legions, the role of the average soldier was highly dependent upon your income, land ownership and position in society. As a citizen army, each man was responsible for equipping himself to fight, the poorest citizens, and young sons generally constituted the Velites (the most lightly equipped of soldiers, comprised mostly of the 5th social class, the proletarii) Hastati were generally slightly better off, able to afford better equipment, and so were from the higher class. Principes were a step higher, either promoted Hastati, or richer citizens who could afford better equipment. Triarii were usually veterans, who had previously served, rich with spoils from war. Cavalry were generally recruited from the young men of the knight class. (hence Equites - Equestrian order) \\n So in comes Marius, and the major point of his reforms. By recruiting from the 6th social order, the portion of the citizenry previously referred to as the capite censi (lit. Head Count) potential soldiers could simply not afford to buy their own equipment. Through service they could become enfranchised, Roman Citizens and gain land and spoils. Unsurprisingly many flocked to join the new legions. The state then had to supply the arms and equipment, leading to the creation of the new soldier: the legionary with equipment closely matching the pre-marian Principes. The only way for the state to easily equip and maintain the legions was through standardisation, and Marius accounted for this, his reforms changed how the legion's baggage was handled, their equipment and their organisation as a standing army. Vastly increasing the nascent empire's military effectiveness. \\n Of course, the reforms were instrumental in the rise of tyrants, the destruction of the republic and the creation of the Roman Empire. \\n TL;DR It didn't change instantly, but yes, the Marian reforms did remove the previous organisation of the Roman army into Hastati, Principe and Triarii, and in its place put the Legionary. \\n For further reading look at 'The Making of the Roman Army: from Republic to Empire' Also, Goldsworthy's 'The Roman Army at war 100BC-200AD' for a (lot) more information. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('In response to your first question regarding Shinto/nationalism: \\n \\n See Fujitani Takashi\\'s  Splendid Monarchy  where it lays out how the Meiji leaders shaped the nation through the manipulation of Shinto practices and superstition and tying these ideas into the created symbol of the Emperor. \\n \\n Shinto before 1868 was highly merged with Buddhism, but in the Meiji period Shinto and Buddhism were separated. Shinto, as it is more a vague space of terms, became an easy vehicle to create the concept of a nation and regain public confidence since there was a regime change and the populace was not too pleased with its government\\'s cozy tendencies with the foreigners barraging into Japan. \\n \\n How was Shinto used? It gave a mythical element to the Emperor and legitimacy. It made the country \"united\" from a random set of villages that are mildly aware of each other. The leadership was highly involved in this process, and many aspects were manufactured. This is where some \"traditional Japanese\" statements get said in public discourse, when in actuality, it\\'s made up traditional Japanese. \\n \\n Yes, technically Shinto became a bit of a political ideology, generally just known as State Shinto, since it was run by the government. (It even has its own branch for a few years.) \\n \\n I wouldn\\'t say Shinto influenced the decision to participate. Japan\\'s decisions as early as 1931 were clearly not Shinto/religious based, but more so colonial and imperial. However, sometimes it was used as part of political rhetoric to spearhead causes or excuse them. \\n \\n Lastly, background speaking: for a good understanding of the Shinto/Buddhism divide that happens with the Meiji Restoration, I highly recommend  The Invention of Religion in Japan  by Jason Josephson. \\n \\n \\n So basically, tl;dr: Shinto is used and abused by leadership, because by removing Buddhism from Shintoism it\\'s a far more broad, open-ended idea of the world than a strict religion. Therefore, it\\'s easy to use and manipulate in the political sphere. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"If I've missed someone saying this in the thread, forgive me. Colonial America was divided between the north and the south: in the north, there were mostly people who wanted to get away from the social structures they'd left behind in Europe, while in the south, there were mostly people who wanted to carry those structures over, only with themselves on top. (Yes, this is a huge oversimplification. Forget it, I'm on a roll.) Slavery existed in the north, mostly for household servants and industrial labor, but it made much more sense in the south, where it provided cheap agricultural labor. The north profited from slavery immensely, by insuring slave traders and buying the raw materials the south produced, among other things. But one way of understanding the Civil War is that the north began to get the idea that a slave-holding south wasn't in its financial interests. The war was fought in large part to prevent the expansion of slavery westward, which would have upset the fragile economic and political balance of the antebellum period. \\n As well, the north industrialized much earlier than the south, leading to two fundamentally different economic orders. In the north, there were free farmers, financial services, and industry. In the south, it was almost all agriculture all the time: mostly small free farms with fewer, large-scale plantations staffed by slaves thrown in. \\n So far, just basic history. The result of the initial conditions I've sketched out is that the northern part of the US developed as a relatively homogeneous, industrialized society. Yes, they had trouble absorbing immigrants from Ireland, Italy and Eastern Europe, but as most people know, the northern part of the US is basically white. As a result, it developed on a similar track to western Europe, what most of us would recognize as liberal democracy. \\n The south, on the other hand, was both rural  and  divided racially. That meant it developed much more unequally, closer to what you would see in Latin America. Sociologically, the South resembles Colombia or Brazil in a lot of ways. \\n Anyway, what about California and the rest of the West Coast? Well, they developed relatively late, and many of the people who migrated to the large coastal cities did so because they wanted to escape the racial and economic divides in their home states. The people who settled inland were often poor farmers (read: Okies) who brought their existing prejudices with them. \\n Again, all oversimplified, and it leaves out some parts, such as why Los Angeles or San Francisco grew up into tolerant, multi-cultural cities, or the effect religion has on all of it, but there you have it. \\n tldr;  Whities in the north and west didn't have to keep brown people down, but the crackers in the south did. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"Through history our perception of things changes. I know that during the Elizabethan era having black rotten teeth was the height of fashion. People even used to dye their teeth to make it look like they were rotting. This was because if your teeth were rotten it meant you ate a lot of sugar which was much more expensive than it is now. The super rich even had rooms to eat in just for the desert course of a meal. I am sure certain civilisations have idealised being fat because they have the means to get fat. Dickens I have found was quite judgemental of fat people in his writing, mr bumble and uncle pumplechook as just a few examples, which does strike me that it was probably a fad among the rich (as Dickens quite often criticised the upper and middle class). \\n Germany suffered heavily during the first world war due to a reliance on a (relatively) high fat diet. During the blockade of German ports they could not support their army and population effectively, which was one of the major reasons for such a quick end to the first world war. The German people wanted out.

Firstly, the Russian Empire wasn't particularly  wealthy and was considered  backwards in comparison to many European powers, namely due to the fact that it had yet to undergo the same level of industrialisation as had Britain, France and Germany. \\nAdditionally, the many of Russia's rural peasantry still lived in feudalistic communities, and were particularly vulnerable to the effects of famine during the late 19th century (severe famines beginning in 1891 left an estimated 350,000 dead). \\n Workers in cities such as St. Petersburg and Moscow also had it tough at the turn of the century due to population growth and rapid industrialisation. A surplus of available labour reduced wages of industrial workers, and increased crowding lead to cramped and unsanitary living conditions. Increased tax rates and high interest rates in population centres also negatively effected Russia's working class. \\n tl;dr The Russian Empire was considered backwards in comparison to the key European states. Many of the social and economic problems faced by Russia at the turn of the century soon led to the fall of tsarism \\n Hope this answered part of your question \\n\",\n  0),\n ('It\\'s really because of a combination of several factors, a few of which you have touched upon already. \\n \\n Firstly, post- 1945, The British found it no longer logistically possible to control and maintain an empire of the size of India which has an incredibly dynamic demographic. This is mainly attributed as being the repercussions of having taken a big part in WWII. In reality, WWII only hastened what would have been an inevitability within the following decade. \\n \\n Secondly - India, pre-independence was not a country in the sense that we understand it today. It was a collection of a large number of princely states. The British, en route to assuming power over the entire Indian subcontinent, used to constantly pit rival princely states against each other and grant favour to those that sided with them. Gradually, the British even betrayed some of the princely states that aligned with them thereafter unintentionally \\'uniting\\' all of India under the British rule. This can be illustrated by the widespread use of English in India.\\nEven today, English is spoken and understood in every corner of the country. (Which is quite extraordinary in a land of over a 100 languages and dialects) \\n \\n \\n This unintended sense of unity that they fostered was an important happening that led to discontent with the British. This was given further impetus by the freedom movement that had been gaining in momentum. \\n \\n Thirdly - The freedom movement is an integral part in the Indianised narrative that is commonly known and accepted in India but often, the misconception is held that this is the most important/only reason for independence. It would not have been possible in 1947 without the happening of the above mentioned (and a few more) factors. \\nHowever, the importance of the freedom movement cannot be undermined either. It was extremely important and galvanised people into a kind of nationalistic fervour. (Remember, the concept of a \"nation\" was still new.) Historian Ramachandra Guha in his increible book  India After Gandhi remarks on how he finds India to be an \"unnatural nation\" because by all logic it shouldn\\'t exist as it isn\\'t formed on grounds that other countires are commonly formed. (Race, language, religion, topography, tribe, climatic conditions etc. It is far too diverse in literally all these aspects)  \\n \\n With this background, it is possible to imagine the sheer difficulty of the task of instilling a nationalistic spirit and glavanising people to rebel, non-violently, against an empire. The non-violent movement would therefore, in this light, be deemed successful because of the \"Us vs. Them\\' concept that was used to create a strong national identity. \\n Before I end this post, I would like to take the time to clear up another misconception about the Indian freedom struggle. This is with reference to the misconception that once freedom was sought, the British packed up and moved back to England and that was the end of British association with Indian administration. This is generally the right-wing Indian political narrative and it ignores the many good things that came out of the British rule in India. (hospitals, schools, railways etc) \\n It may be of interest to note, that the current ruling party of Indian Govenment was established by an Englishman (A. O. Hume) so that India could have some political representation. This was even before independence. Post independence, the painstaking task of inttegrating the hundreds of princely states was done by Sardar Vallabhai Patel with the assistance of a Lord Mountbatten. \\nExamples of these are various. \\n TL;DR - A combination of factors.

The pilot had to get the aircraft to the designated altitude to bomb,  at the same time making any course corrections. \\nIf a gunner shouted for a corkscrew it meant they were under direct attack, the pilot would put the plane in a steep drive to try and escape. Likewise if the aircraft was caught in searchlights harsh evasive maneuvers would be made to escape the lights. \\n When closing in to the target the pilot had to keep the aircraft straight and level whilst the bomb aimer gave tiny course corrections, when the magic \"bombs gone!\" words were said they might  still  need to keep steady to give the camera enough times to take the pictures.\\nFinally the pilot could sweep the plane away and leave as quickly as possible. \\n This assumes that it was possible to bomb the prime target, if cloud cover prevented this, the pilot had to make the decision if to bomb blind or re-route to the secondary target. \\n Return trips were often a nightmare. A damaged aircraft was almost a certainty, possibly injured crew to consider as well. Damage to the aircraft might mean radio communication with the crew was impossible. If the navigator was injured or unable to do his job the pilot would have to figure out a way to get home. \\n The pilot was responsible for his entire crew, so if he didn\\'t think they could make it back he had to make the decision to tell his crew to bail out, preferably over allied territory. if there was no time a crash landing would be attempted. \\n Even if they could make it back there was much to pay attention to - approaching home shores could be difficult - it wasn\\'t unknown for aircraft to be shot at by their own \"side\", usually over zealous defenders in anti aircraft batteries. Then, once over their home airfield the pilot would have to circle and prepare to land. I forget the exact statistic but on the allied side there were quite a lot of accidents on the home approach - aircraft running in to each other, unknown damage causing a bad landing (e.g. gear collapsing or non functional) and so on. \\n It must have been hell, tired after a 10 hour sortie with injured crew to find that your damaged aircraft\\'s landing gear didn\\'t work, low on fuel you had no choice but to belly land and hope the aircraft stayed in one piece and you didn\\'t kill your crew. \\n Once on the ground de-brief with an intelligence officer would happen, probably with some refreshments, you\\'d update your flight log and drag yourself to bed, wondering if your pals made it home. \\n TL;DR Pilots would have loved to be bored!

His wounds were severe; he was brought before a French general, who instructed that his personal surgeon attend to the officer at once.  He survived, though he would remain weak and sickly for the rest of his life, and was knighted for his actions during the battle upon his return to England.  The general may well have forgotten about him in the chaos of all that followed, and, then again, he may not -- but he would have cause to recall him later. \\n That officer was William George Keith Elphinstone, son of the director of the British East India Company and nephew to Admiral Lord Keith.  The general was Napoleon Bonaparte. \\n There are two consequences of this essentially chivalrous encounter that demand our attention: \\n After the Battle of Waterloo,  Napoleon  fled the field and eventually made his way to the port at Rochefort.  There was some talk of attempting to escape to America, but the British Royal Navy had judiciously blockaded the port in advance of the deposed Emperor\\'s arrival and this route was well and truly cut off.  With no real alternatives available, Napoleon sent emissaries to treat with Capt. Maitland of HMS  Bellerophon , offering his surrender in exchange for passage to England to meet with his victorious enemies.  These terms were accepted, and Napoleon duly surrendered himself and his retinue to Maitland.  The  Bellerophon  arrived at Plymouth Harbour on July 26th, 1815; by July 31st, the decision had been made to send Napoleon into exile on St. Helena.  How did this decision come about?  Why was the \"Monster of Europe\" not executed or put in an iron cage? \\n Captain Maitland of the  Bellerophon , in his memoir of the run to Torbay with the emperor aboard ( The Surrender of Napoleon , 1826), includes several extracts from letters to him from Admiral Keith in which the admiral desires him to convey to Napoleon his \"deepest personal obligations\" and to inform the emperor that if he (the admiral) could render him any personal service, he would \"consider it [his] duty, as well as in gratitude.\"  These extraordinary declarations were on account of the emperor\\'s involvement in the rescue of Admiral Keith\\'s wounded nephew on the field at Waterloo, and the admiral was one of the most influential voices in determining the fate of the fallen Emperor. \\n Napoleon arrived on St. Helena and was installed at Longwood House by the end of 1815.  He would live out the rest of his days on the island, dying at last in May of 1821. \\n The fate of  Elphinstone  was a far less happy one, and not just for him. \\n During the course of the First Afghan-Anglo War, the British (with Indian help) had captured Kabul and held it since 1839.  It was taken as an important move in the ongoing and quite delicate dance with the Russians, who were attempting to expand their colonial holdings and trade domination in the area. \\n The war had seen the Emir of Afghanistan, Dost Mohammad Khan, forcibly deposed for his decision to side with the Russians.  Popular sentiment against the British ran incredibly high, and the Emir\\'s son, the daring Akbar Khan, took up the task of conducting periodic raids on the British and Indian forces in and around the city. \\n A perfect storm of incompetence and failure saw the situation swiftly deteriorate.  The British tried to live in Kabul as though it were a regular European city, putting on plays, organizing sporting events, throwing lavish parties and whatnot, and this greatly disrupted the Afghans\\' long-established way of life.  The British government back home wasn\\'t exactly pleased about it either, and made heavy cuts to the money being sent every month to the garrison at Kabul, citing the extravagant expense of the parties and whatnot.  Unfortunately, this money had  actually  been being primarily used to bribe local tribes into accepting the British presence. \\n With these bribes cut off, Akbar Khan managed to raise a united Afghan army.  He encouraged a popular uprising in Kabul itself, which saw several important British diplomats and their staffs murdered, their buildings razed, and an essential supply depot seized.  The city\\'s British governor convened a meeting with Akbar to negotiate a truce, but he and his retinue were fallen upon and massacred when they reached the agreed upon spot.  His body was dragged through the streets, to the Afghans\\' great delight. \\n Akbar Khan delivered an ultimatum to  Major-General William George Keith Elphinstone , who had become commander of the garrison at Kabul: leave at once, or risk open warfare in street and field. \\n Elphinstone, by this point a sickly, fearful, and grossly incompetent man, acquiesced to the demands with the condition that Akbar grant him, his men, and their various civilian attendants safe passage from Kabul to the British station at Jalalabad.  As part of his capitulation, Elphinstone would even surrender virtually all of the British weapons before leaving.  Akbar not surprisingly agreed, and even offered to provide an escort when the British departed. \\n What happened next is almost too awful to describe. \\n The column that left Kabul in January of 1842 was just over 16,000 strong -- 12,000 civilians and something like 4500 troops of mixed distribution.  Jalalabad was 90 miles away, and a difficult journey at the best of times; this time, it would have to be made through freezing conditions and deep snow. \\n In the end, that didn\\'t matter.  Akbar Khan, acting entirely within the character established by his previous actions, swiftly rescinded every offer he had made.  Believing Akbar\\'s claims of peace, Elphinstone had left all the ill, the injured, the weak and the infirm back in Kabul; these were all murdered as soon as the column left.  The column itself fell under attack shortly thereafter, with Akbar\\'s promised escort completely failing to appear and his own troops taking to the hills to snipe at the British as they trudged along.  Sniping turned to skirmishes; skirmishes to all-out raids.  By the end of the third day, 3,000 had been killed. \\n Several days later, Elphinstone -- now in complete despair -- surrendered himself to Akbar Khan in hopes of sparing the rest of the column.  He received assurances that this would be so, but even though he would die in captivity four months later, his surrender bought nothing at all.  The column now consisted of just over 2200 people, only 200 of them soldiers; the attacks continued.  By the end of that day, it would be reduced to 65 soldiers, making their last stand on a hill at Gandamak.  Seven were taken prisoner; the rest went down fighting. \\n The next day, the remainder of the column arrived at Jalalabad: a single man on a broken horse.  This was a surgeon named William Brydon.  He was the only one to make it. \\n TL;DR:  Had Napoleon Bonaparte been less kind to a wounded English officer in 1815, Napoleon might well have been executed -- and, decades later, 16,000 lives might have been saved. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"The Vatican has extensive libraries, some of them full of secret documents that might contain just about anything.

Originally thou/you was a simple singular/plural distinction, but over time \"you\" (or ye) also became the singular formal pronoun.  Eventually, the number of people you could thou (a verb meaning \\'to use the informal pronoun\\'--I never get the chance to use it) diminished and thou disappeared. \\n It was a gradual process, and varied geographically.  By the time of Shakespeare and King James using it already implied a close familiarity with the listener, or a disrespect for them.  IIRC that\\'s present in Shakespeare.  KJV keeps a pure singular/plural distinction to accurately reflect the singular/plural distinction present in second-person pronouns in both Hebrew and Greek, following the practice of Tynedale.  Using \"thou\" for people you\\'d address formally (like God) was already out of style then.  By the mid 1600s it was probably used only for people you\\'d talk down to (children and animals) and it was pretty much gone by the 1700s.  Note that I\\'m extrapolating--it\\'s clearly around in the early 1600s but on the way out in the 1700s, I\\'m using other dialects to fill in the gap as I\\'ll explain in a moment.  So it was used in the early 1600s, but was only really used for people you could talk down a little to (family, very close friends), but it went away within the next century after.  Note that when the Quakers called everyone \"thou\" except God in the mid-1600s, people were actually offended.  It took a while longer for people to not realize that thou is informal, and just think of it as archaic. \\n However, it\\'s important to note that the above is talking mostly about Southern England English.  \"Thou\" survived much longer in other dialects in England.  It died out only within the last century in some rural parts of Northern England.  \"Tha\" was generally used instead of \"thou\" (think of you usually say \"you\"--it often is pronounced \"ya\"), but the usage was largely the same.  It\\'s pretty much entirely gone today, though. \\n tl;dr it happened in the 1600s for the most part in Southern England, but much later in other areas. \\n see [here]( and [here]( for more info. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"The thing about WWI is that it wasn't supposed to be a long war. For the most part, Germany was all about the offensive. The Von Schlieffen Plan would call for the German military to sweep through Belgium and cut off a coastal invasion from the British (something they remembered to do in WWII). If they maintained the line then France would fall very quickly. Instead, General Moltke of Germany decided to pull some of the forces from the line to support the French counter-attack at the Marne. This was a costly mistake since the Germans could have flanked the French at this battle. After this, both sides decided to dig in and duke it out for the next four years. If the Germans didn't break the line then we would see a repeat of the Franco-Prussian War. That would be the only way both sides could have reduced bloodshed. \\n Both sides desperately tried to gain the upper hand by coming up with better weapons and tactics. The Germans employed the Maxim Gun very early and mowed down British and French troops at the Somme. The British retaliated with the Mark IV Tank and were able to cross over the trenches. However, the tanks did not change the tide of war. Both sides used chemical weapons such as mustard gas and chlorine. They were very effective, so much so that chemical weapons have been banned for their horrifying efficiency. At the end of the day it seems that everyone was trying to reduce deaths. \\n One thing that both sides could have done (without developing weapons) was to improve the trench system. If they were able to get water out of the trenches, then diseases and complications of them would have been drastically reduced. This also could have stopped the Spanish Flu in 1918 if done properly. \\n TL;DR The Germans should have stuck to the plan. Both sides did exactly what you were thinking. The trenches themselves killed a lot of people too. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('IIRC, they had to borrow the money to buy themselves from the slave owners. The repayment took around a century and a half. \\nIt had barely been paid off when the Duvaliers borrowed colossal amounts of money \"For Haiti\". After the Duvaliers fled in a hail of bullets, the international community was insistent that these loans be repaid, not by the Duvaliers, who had received the money, but by the people of Haiti, who had no say in contracting the loans, and received no benefit from them. \\nWhen Haiti finally became unable to meet the payments, the IMF rode in to lend yet more money, which mysteriously also failed to benefit the people of Haiti, but which had to be repaid by them. To get these loans, the Haitian government had to agree to dismantle the tariff protections which had kept the economy of Haiti limping along.  Now, subsistence rice farmers had to compete with large foreign agricultural corporations. These foreign corporations sold food cheap until the agricultural economy collapsed completely, and there was no more money. Then they left the Haitians to eat economic freedom, which tastes a lot like [fried dirt]( \\nBTW, One Haitian president did suggest that other countries should give back the money that was stolen. You may remember the rapidity and violence with which he was overthrown, by entirely indigenous forces, utterly unconnected with the countries that had just been asked to give back what they stole, and in no way aided by any foreign government. \\n TL;DR: Haiti has always been a very rich country, but other countries keep stealing everything they have. \\n',\n  0),\n ('This is an excellent answer, but Hannibal\\'s legacy is almost just as important. \\n The victory at Cannae especially has inspired generals ever since that battle. Hannibal took a smaller army, which was in hostile territory and at the end of a long supply chain, and used both patience and superior strategy to destroy an enemy army. And by destroy an army, every ancient account declares that the Roman army was utterly shattered, it no longer existed as a useful military organization. Because of this, Hannibal theoretically held the Romans at his mercy (and here we can derive the great criticism of Hannibal and the whole decisive battle concept), he was in a superior position and could move unmolested until the Romans raised a new army. \\n This battle has been a great inspiration to generals ever since. But for our modern way of war, the battles of Napoleon reached for the same objective, the complete destruction of the enemy army. When he achieved these victories (like at Jena, or Austerlitz) he was able to dictate peace terms to the conquered powers, and to force them out of the war. And Napoleon was  very  inspired by the regalia of the Roman Empire. \\n However, like Hannibal, Napoleon was eventually overcome. But men like Carl Von Clausewitz immortalized \"Napoleonic\" war (or the decicive battle) in his book  On War . This book reiterated the importance of destroying the enemy army first. And Clausewitz has inspired generals in the United States, Germany, France, and others ever since. In fact, it could be easily argued that  On War  is currently the most important work concerning modern war. It follows in Hannibals footsteps, to seek the decisive, army destroying battle. \\n Hannibal\\'s battles even inspired the German strategy for World War One, General Schlieffen\\'s infamous strategy sought to create a half-Cannae, where the German center would fall back to allow the right wing to sweep around the French army and surround it. Helmuth von Moltke (the Younger) would adopt that strategy into the \"Double Cannae\", where he (unfortunately for the war effort) strengthened the left wing of the army to produce a double envelopment of the French army. \\n TL;DR:  Hannibal showed generals, in the most famous, and arguably most complete example, that enemy armies could be shattered. His battle proved that, if a general took just enough risk, created the perfect stratagem, and had the proper balance of aggression and patience, they could destroy the enemy and leave their nation at the mercy of the victor. Hannibal showed the way towards a mythical \"perfect victory\" which would end hostilities with one, decisive strike. Reinforced by the victories of Napoleon, this paradigm of the decisive battle has become one of the dominant theories in modern warfare. That philosophical tradition has its roots at Cannae, and that is why we still talk about the greatness of Hannibal, and not someone like Pyrrhus. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"Wow. Okay. I'll give you the three main approaches to this topic that current historiography focuses on. \\n First , there is the argument that the 'fall of the East preceded the rise of the West'. Historians like Janet Abu-Lughod ('‘The World System in the Thirteenth Century: Dead-End or Precursor?'), Immanuel Wallerstein, ('The West, Capitalism and the Modern World-System') and C.A. Bayly ('Archaic and Modern Globalization in the Eurasian and African Arena, c.1750-1850') suggest that a key reason for Western hegemony was the collapse and failings of the archaic economic systems of the East. Essentially, the Eastern agrarian empires of the fifteenth century onwards were founded upon earlier systems that had aborted, and during the early-modern period made choices that saw them restrict their long term ability to compete with the at-the-time 'weak' Europe. For example China's destruction of its navy by the 1440s, or the sheer size of the Afro-Asian regions discouraging initiative thinking in the same way that the feudal system in Europe created a the individualisation of the bourgeoise. \\n This group of historians, especially Wallerstein explain the development of Europe in this period in terms of the  longue duree  - namely this period saw the preconditions for European domination being generated, which would allow the later precipitant of the Industrial Revolution to trigger rapid European expansion and a fundamental transformation of the world, to the extent that it was an acceleration of existing characteristics rather than the introduction of new ones. Europe was able to rise because the domination of Asia was weakened through various factors, and Europe saw several interacting factors at just the right time (the Black Death, the collapse of the Mongol empires, and the cheapening of European controlled trade routes.) \\n Those existing characteristics are highlighted (comparatively or otherwise) by the second group. \\n Second .there is the sinophilic school of Andre Gunder Frank ( ReOrient: Global Economy in the Asian Age ),  PrasannanParthasarathi, ( Why Europe Grew Rich and Asia Did Not: Global Economic Divergence, 1600-1850 ) and others like R. Bin Wong and Kenneth Pomeranz. For these historians, the European hegemony that emerged is not the result of any inherent distinguishing features, but a combination of the economic and ecological environment, the institutions of the state that developed in Europe, and the New World's land (plus its gold and silver). The rise of the west is given a conjunctural explanation - basically Europe became the 'leading power' because of those factors mentioned above but not, as you say from 1500, but actually only from the 1780s and the industrial revolution onwards. I'll try and give you a succinct summary of their argument. Basically, they contend that Asia was the dominant player in the world system and had been for centuries. From 1492 and the discovery of the Americas, \\n >‘the Europeans bought themselves a seat, and then even a whole railway car, on the Asian train’ of trade^1 \\n using the gold and silver capital from the Americas. By this I mean they could pump raw capital into the world economy to purchase Asian products, since there was little European products the Asians were willing to trade for (the usual system of economic interactions of the early-modern period). The two competing, yet interdependent, economic systems by 1780 were thus the still weak, proto-capitalist, merchant-naval European empires, such as the Spanish, or Dutch, against the still dominant, ‘traditional’, agrarian, land-based, Smithian empires of Asia, such as China or the Mughals. Even until this point European powers were not dominating the world system. \\n That domination occurred because of the Industrial Revolution from the 1780s onwards. This is where the third approach comes in. \\n Third , ( I do not agree with these historians, but I will give you their misguided arguments ) People like David Landes ( The Wealth and Poverty of Nations ) and E.L. Jones ( Growth Recurring: Economic Change in World History ) suggest that the Industrial Revolution was an event that could only have happened in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries, because only Europe had the resources, geography and civilisational ability to make the leap from a pre-industrial to an industrial society. \\n >'Britain had the making and Britain made itself' \\n argues Landes and there is little denying the fact that Europe certainly had situational advantages the 'Rest' did not.  However , Landes and co.'s approach is very teleological and tautological, and heavily Eurocentric, and lacks an appreciation of the wider context that other approaches have with regards to the issue. For example, Landes argues that China was fundamentally unable and unwilling to adapt to the 'superior' European methods and economic systems and therefore its own stubborness saw resulted in its own downfall. \\n Much better historians like Eric Hobsbawm ( The Age of Revolution: Europe 1789–1848 ) provide much more solid and rounded explanations. As he states, it is better to argue that the developments during the three centuries following 1492, including the creation and expansion of mercantile empires, the creation of a captive periphery in the Americas, and the proto-capitalist economies of the Carribean and Americas (in the form of plantation systems where whole sections of the society were geared towards production) all provided the basis for the Industrial Revolution to bring Europe to the fore. The New World in particular eased the land constraints within Europe (in the shape of 'ghost area' colonies) and allowed Britain in particular to access coal and thereby shift from the biological/organic  ancien regime  to the inorganic industrial economy. At the same time, from 1815 onwards European colonial empires saw huge swathes of land being colonized by European industrial powers, and contributing to the economic expansion. From that point onwards (1800) European hegemony was guaranteed. in the short term at least. \\n There is also the suggestion of an economic distinction between China's Smithian approach (i.e. the division of labour and specialisation) and Europe's decision of Schumpeterian economic growth (i.e. a continuous increase in productivity with the addition of capital in forms of technology) which fits in with the availability of labour and the shortage of land in the East, versus the availability of land and the shortage of labour in the West. \\n The general argument, therefore, as to why Europe was able to gain an unassailable lead, regardless of approach, shows some remarkably consistent features: \\n \\n The fall of the East and the foundations of the rise of the West \\n The New World and the creation of early-modern mercantile empires which created proto-capitalist systems throughout the world, including in Europe and Asia. \\n The Industrial Revolution and the shift from organic economies to inorgancic ones, saw characteristics of the pre-industrial world accelerated and saw Europe rise to the fore much more quickly than Asia.   \\n \\n TL/DR  Europe was in the right place, at the right time, with the right circumstantial history, and the right systems in place that when the Industrial Revolution happened, its hegemony was cemented. \\n Sources: All the historians I mentioned above are brilliant (except Landes). Otherwise, for a really good history, see John Darwin's  After Tamerlane: The Rise and Fall of Global Empires 1400-2000  - I cannot recommend it enough! \\n ^1 Andre Gunder Frank,  ReOrient: Global Economy in the Asian Age  (London, 1998), p.277 \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"You are absolutely correct that particularly powerful and wealthy landowners had quite a bit of say in how inheritance proceeded.  But with that said, this is also because the equal field system didn't really apply to them. \\n The equal field system was primarily a way for the government to more effectively extract taxes from the poor peasants that constituted the bulk of chinese population.  However, the government was limited in what land they could issue as equal field, primarily because of the existing ownership of the more productive land from wealthier landowners, who obviously were exempt from the equal field system (for example, most of the land around the capital was large aristocratic estates, not equal field).  Because once again, the system was for peasants, not the wealthy landowners. \\n This is why equal field was mostly reimplemented in the areas of the north which the previous northern dynasties controlled.  It seems that the system was never implemented in the south, along the Yangzi regions, as records show that the Tang government derived the bulk of its income in the southern regions from its salt monopoly and business taxes, as opposed to peasant farm taxes. \\n As well, there was no effective prohibition from the buying and selling of state land, thus reducing equal field effectiveness even further as what should've been peasant land ended up being consolidated further into wealthy hands in times where peasants were faced with dire hardships.  Despite its detriment to state coffers, it wasn't uncommon for peasants to prefer tenancy under an aristocratic landlord to direct subjection under the imperial bureaucracy, for reasons quite analogous to the situation in the late Roman Empire.  The wealthy could provide a degree of protection from imperial tax collectors, in exchange for the peasants' autonomy. \\n tl;dr - The reimplementation of the equal field system in Tang China had to co-exist with existing private ownership (which was likely larger, and owned the most productive land), so was thus relegated to second tier land.  Thus any theoretical egalitarian inheritance of equal field was disrupted by wealthy private interests. \\n \\n Source - Lewis, Mark Edward.

My degree is actually in nursing, but I have done extensive historical research in three main areas. 1) History of sex and Sexuality 2) History of HIV/AIDS and the medical implications and 3) the history of nursing particularly in Britain and then Canada. (I\\'m also a hockey history buff but haven\\'t done enough actual research in order to call that a main history knowledge). [Here is a recent, sourced, comment I left in /r/askscience  about HIV transmission]( \\n This falls under my first category of knowledge. \\n So the very first thing you need to know about genitalia is that it\\'s naturally self-cleaning. Vaginas have a natural slightly acidic PH (cause by lactobacilli) and create mucus that \"flush\" the vagina on a regular basis. Penises not only have pre-ejaculate that acts as a \"wash\" of the urethra  prior to sex Urine also naturally cleans the urethra after sex. So the area is naturally cleaned by the body. \\n As for the exterior of the body then it\\'s really dependant on the place and era in question. Most of my historical research is based from the 18th century onwards. However certain assumptions can be made based on known hygienic practices of each era. We also need to remember that cleanliness is relevant if you look at 18th century France, unwashed bodies were the norm so there wouldn\\'t be anything unusual with having sexual relations with a person who hadn\\'t completely washed in weeks/months/years. As a  recent  example, pornography from the 70\\'s and 80\\'s typically depicted women with pubic hair. In pornography produced today, most women have no pubic hair, or if they do it\\'s usually trimmed and carefully shaped. If you ask most of the younger population they will tell you that pubic hair is \"Gross\", sexual trends and norms can and do change rapidly. \\n To pick on the Roman\\'s we know that they took their hygiene very seriously. They had large and numerous bath-houses through-out rome and their empire. While soap didn\\'t exist (or only the very rich owned it/could use it) they instead used oil as a way of removing dirt. They covered their bodies with it and then scraped it away with a tool known as a [Strigil]( this would also have the benefit of killing or greatly reducing the number of lice on the body. So their genitalia hygiene was likely quiet good and didn\\'t smell or produce odours out of the norm for the time. \\n Unless they had a sexually transmitted infection[[STI]( \\n Most of the documentation out there that we can find isn\\'t about health genitals it\\'s about unhealthy ones!  We know things like Lice for instance have been around since more or less the dawn of man. In fact [Herodotus [500-424 BC]]( Describes how Egyptian priests got rid of lice: \"The priests shave themselves all over their body every other day, so that no lice or any other foul thing may come to be upon them when they minister to the gods.\" \\n Other STI\\'s are mentioned  in the bible . \\n One of the earliest well documented cases of STI infections/epidemic is from 1494.

From there it spread like wild fire across europe and into the new world, killing an estimated [5 million people]( in Europe. \\n Gonorrhea aka \"the clap\" has ties going back to the bible  some scholars  and   zav  (for males) as gonorrhea.

Silver proteinate became the treatment of choice from 1897 until antibiotics came on the market in the 1940\\'s. \\n The \"Social Hygiene\" movement of the late 19th and early 20th century was a powerful tilt in the world of sexual health and cleanliness. They formed in order to control venereal diseases (now know at STI\\'s) regulate prostitution and share scientific teachings. It is here were many of our common sexual health misconceptions come from (such as women should douche to \"Stay clean\").  Also they were a driving force behind the pseudoscience of eugenics and forced sterilization of \"undesirable\" (including those with STI\\'s) was the norm up until the 1930\\'s. This took place not only in Nazi Germany but in America, Canada, and Sweden which didn\\'t stop [forced sterilizations until 1976]( \\n I could continue with examples but in order to save you reading I\\'ll finish with this; sexual health and cleanliness is fluid and what\\'s \"in\" right now might not be \"in\" later. I\\'m always amused that people seem to think that anal sex has been  \"invented\" in the last 20 years or so.

Not sure your background and level of knowledge so I can give a little more if you need to know more.  Short answer is that the majority of Europe and the former colonial possessions of continental European powers are part of a legal tradition ultimately rooted in Roman law and particularly the Corpus Juris Civilus, know as the civil law tradition.  In England, a different tradition called the common law tradition developed out of the courts of the King that was developed out of the application of law to particular facts.  The civil law tradition to this day is more \"academic,\" more based on developing a coherent theory of the law and applying general principals to particular details, while the common law is more \"pragmatic,\" following the twisty development of its legal past.  A law degree in the civil law sense is almost like a liberal art (though it isn\\'t one of the seven) rather than a professional degree intended to prepare you for a particular job. \\n In fact, in England until surprisingly recently--the mid 18th century--if you went to Oxford and studied Law you would not study the common law at all.  You would essentially study the same law that a person at a university in France would study, even though France had a civil law tradition and England did not.  Common law Barristers were trained at Inns of Court rather than universities in something that could vaguely be described as an apprenticeship program. \\n In the mid 18th century, a very influential scholar of the common law named William Blackstone finally started to teach law and Oxford.  But the mid-18th century is after the colonies that would become the United States had developed their own lawyers and traditions that would develop more or less separately from the mother country.  At the time of the separation, law was something taught independently rather than in a university. \\n For the first century of US history after separation, law retained its nature as a profession that was learned pragmatically rather than academically--through apprenticeships and independent study.  Towards the end of the 19th century, Christopher Columbus Langdell took over the deanship of Harvard Law School.  Under his tenure, Harvard adopted a new method of legal education called the \"case method\" wherein students read a legal case ahead of class, then the professor leads a \"Socratic\" discussion of the case, asking students about the facts and legal principals set forth in the case.  If you\\'ve ever seen The Paper Chase, you\\'ve seen this method in action, and while it has declined at many law schools it still is considered the \"traditional\" kind of legal education in the US.  This method, as well as Langdell\\'s first year legal curriculum of Contracts, Torts, Civil Procedure, Criminal Law, and Property eventually caught on at other law schools, around the 1890s.  As with the case method, there is some agitation for change and there has been some addition, but those are still courses that every US law student will take in their first year. \\n Around the same time as Langdell was reforming Harvard, the American Bar Association was founded.  It was one instance of a general thrust to modernize and professionalize a lot of the professions--this is around the time as I understand it that the practice of medicine became more academic and scientific.  In order to increase the professionalism and knowledge of practicing lawyers, in 1890 the ABA began to press states to require a law degree in order to sit for the bar examination.  They were ultimately successful in many states, which expanded the popularity of getting a law degree--but given the history of not teaching law as an undergraduate course, it was the sort of professional school it is today. \\n It\\'s also worth noting that in the earlier part of the 20th century there were a lot of less academic law schools--night schools and the like.  The ABA ultimately managed to get most states to require a degree from an ABA accredited law school in order to take the bar.  The strict rules of ABA accreditation have lead to a lot of uniformity in legal education. California is perhaps the most notable exception. \\n Note that while the ABA was very successful in replacing apprenticeship with academic study, there are still state Bar Associations including the Washington State Bar Association, of which I am a member, where you can become a lawyer through a apprenticeship-type program.  Many legal jobs require an ABA accredited law degree as well as a license to practice law, but there are still people who come into law the old-fashioned way. \\n TL:DR:  Because people in the US didn\\'t study law in universities at all until the ABA said they had to and the ABA created a graduate/professional degree system instead of an undergrad system. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"I'm going to speak only in my expertise (Ancient China) but I'm pretty sure this applies to a lot of the generals of the ancient world. In Ancient China, generals were powerful people in both warfare and politics. It was critical to any Dynasties success that you had to have able generals who knew strategy (Sun Tzu's Art of War was very prominent). Once a general had to march an army, they were assigned other generals who they were in charge of and they often split into multiple armies. It was also common to be assigned some strategists or advisers who were knowledgeable of key factors such as weather, geography and even battle strategy. \\n It was up to the commander of the army to decide battle strategy, tactics, when they would attack, if they would withdraw etc. Many generals became famous for their prowess and tactical ability on the field (Xiang Yu, Cao Cao, Guan Yu etc). Through victories, generals gained more and more fame, higher positions in the political spectrum and were often granted posts in cities where they would become prefects and would often lead out armies themselves if their city was attacked. \\n While there's no doubt that sometimes victory was achieved because of superior numbers or a better army (which you can credit to the generals for having such superior trained troops), that wasn't always the case in Ancient China. Cao Cao who was probably the most successful leader during the Three Kingdoms period (220-280), was able to defeat his bitter rival Yuan Shao at the battle of Guandu despite being heavily outnumbered. In contrast, Cao Cao was also defeated at the battle of Chibi despite having vastly superior numbers due to the wit of Zhou Yu. Another example is Xiang Yu defeating his rival Liu Bang with a significantly smaller army at Pengcheng. \\n I apologize if this is a little sloppy, but I hope I shed some light on your question. \\n tl;dr: Yes, generals were hugely important in warfare and even politics. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"OK, folks, a long-winded reply. I’m mostly in agreement with “haimooffauxerre” (though sermons in small parishes were inside as well).  Still, let me weigh in here with a few thoughts to fine tune what I said in my post from long ago quoted in this thread.  There is in fact ancient church legislation mandating Sunday attendance at Mass (which is, of course, consistent with the 3rd Commandment to keep holy the Lord’s Day, which Christians moved from Saturday to Sunday).  The earliest canonical reference I know is the [Council of Elvira] ( (Granada) from c. 306, whose 21 Canon says: “If anyone who lives in the city does not attend church services for three Sundays, let that person be expelled for a brief time in order to make the reproach public.” \\n Legalities aside, there’s the practical question of whether there was a church nearby to attend.  Until the widespread establishment of parishes throughout Europe by the 12th century, there was not always a church close enough to make it to Sunday Mass. So whether you could hear it very much depended on where and when you were.  In the earlier Middle Ages, I take it would be hard for many people to get to a church. Even once parishes were established, in the wilder parts of, say, Spain or Wales, the parochial system might be hit or miss.  Here’s “vonadler” describing the need for “church cottages” in medieval Sweden from a [way back when thread on medieval village buildings] ( \\n > Since churches were few and far apart (not every village had them) and many people had more than half a day's travel to church, a system with church cottages developed. As the population were required by law to attend chrurch at least once a month, they built small cottages next to the church. The people would then travel to the cottages on Saturday morning, arrive during the evening, party, eat, gossip, fight, have sex, go to the shops, meet old friends and extended family and then sleep, to go to church Sunday morning and then head home.  The fact that these church cottages were quite sinful places has always seemed ironic to me. \\n Note too, that Sweden seems to have adapted to the scarcity of churches by mandating a minimum attendance of once a month. \\n Even if there was a church to attend, there wasn’t always a priest to say it.  As parish churches more and more came to fall into the hands of absentee rectors who were obliged to find and pay a vicar or assistant priests to be in residence, depending on the rigor of enforcement, priests might be scarce.  On the other hand, in towns there would be plenty of churches where one could attend Mass, and there is evidence that more pious folk would often attend several a day. \\n But these factors aside, I’m more interested in the influence of social pressure to attend Sunday Mass.  Church legislation regularly stresses that people must honor prohibitions against working on Sundays.  Yes, I know, this suggests some people were doing just that despite the prohibition.  But neighbors were quick to rat out fellow parishioners who missed Sunday Mass.  I don’t have time to extract more than a couple of examples, but here’s an episcopal visitation (a technical term for checking on the spiritual and legal health of a parish) of churches in Hereford, Eng. in 1397: \\n > [The parishioners of Burhill] say that Jenkin Watkins, Harry Twiches, Robin Strange, John Kyfflyhode, Jenkin Cedyche and Hugyn Hull of Hull are common laborers on feast days and Sundays.  They say that Juliana Twiches, Joanna Bolte, Margaret Been, Agnes Copp and Agnes Scate  do not come to church on Sundays and feast days.   Also that Cecilia Claver, Helen Strange, Alice Watkins, Joanna, wife of William Watkins, Clemens Wolfe and Rosa Trigg  do not come to church \\n and \\n > [The parishioners of Eardisley] say also, John Baker  does not come to church on Sundays and feast days.   Also, Isota Lather does not come as well.

But coming up with the general topic was pretty easy — it was just a combination of two things that fascinate me: I\\'ve worked as a journalist for the last few years, and the Spanish Civil War was just a period of history that had always seemed interesting to me, long before I studied it in any detail. \\n I eventually came up with my actual thesis while I was thinking about a much-recycled Philip Graham quote about the purpose of journalism: that it\\'s the \\'first rough draft of history\\' (a phrase I ended up using as my dissertation title.) It struck me as a really interesting prism through which to look at modern history: how does the narrative established by contemporary correspondents and editors affect the historiography? \\n The other thing I noticed was that while war correspondents aren\\'t some kind of forgotten class, and particularly in Spain people like Orwell and George Steer have gone down in history as heroes, they\\'re far better served in popular cultural memory than in actual scholarship. There was essentially one major scholarly text focusing specifically on correspondents in Spain — Paul Preston\\'s  We Saw Spain Die  — and a scattering of chapters in other journalistic histories. To me, it looked like a gap in the scholarship. \\n Unlike Ph.D theses, undergrad dissertations aren\\'t expected to make an actual \"contribution to knowledge\". But I came away from writing my dissertation thinking that if I was going to do a Ph.D (an idea I\\'ve been playing with more and more recently), that\\'d be the niche I\\'d want to write about. \\n So I guess the tl;dr is: \\n \\n start with areas, periods or themes that genuinely interest you. If you\\'re not a nerd for that period of history, it\\'s going to be harder work — you\\'re going to spend the next six months or so reading about it; you better love it! \\n hone in: the general formula is X theme within Y period. You\\'re not writing a history of the Second World War; you\\'re writing an analysis of how Soviet economic policy evolved over the course of the war (for example.) \\n try to find a gap in the scholarship: it means you have to do more widely-dispersed reading to piece together your lit review, but it makes things a lot more interesting. \\n know where your primary sources are, and how you can get to them: if all the key archival material on which your study is going to be based is in China, and you\\'re in America, how are you going to get access to them? Also, do you speak Chinese? This isn\\'t an insurmountable obstacle, but just know where your material is at and how you\\'ll be able to use it (because your supervisor  will  ask!)

Further, when combined with the modern constructions implied in the word \\'world\\', we get a kind of self, \\'world citizens\\', that seems fantastic only because we have been bred in a culture of expansion and globalisation. \\n The question then is do we want \\'world citizens\\'? And if not, what the hell then? \\n My stance is that such a thing is actually the recipe for catastrophe, because it only leads to homogenisation, the disarticulation of the realities that make up different cultures and the end of diversity understood as the living diversity of knowledge, in favour of merely the representation (either through history books, unesco sites, or touristic brochures: its the same) of what was. \\n If I am reading Foucault correctly (note: i am not in the field of history but in media studies), it seems to me that, the point being that Indonesian, Japanese, Amazonic, or European knowledge are all consistent with the worlds their particular societies lived and created, we need to open to the idea of  deep diversity  (my term), and allow all the parallel universes that actually form the diverse cultures to keep on flourishing and constructing their own truth. \\n So, TL;DR, \\'world citizens\\'? we need to talk about that \\n',\n  0),\n ('Yes. \\n If you ever read Neil Gaiman\\'s \"American Gods\" there is a powerful narrative of the first meeting of Vikings and Native Americans.

I\\'m not saying this out of spite for the Left, but because it is true. \\n A lot of New Deal policies are very similar to the Corporate State. Although they are different in structure, they had similar goals and aimed to provide greater protection to labor. The National Labor Relations Board, which is still around today, is probably the closest to directly emulating Corporatism. Also, Hugh Johnson, who headed the National Recovery Administration, was a great admirer of Fascist Corporatism and tried to recreate Corporatism directly into the NRA. \\n The thing we tend to forget or not realize about Fascism is that it is pro-Labor. The goal of Fascism and the Corporate State was to prevent Big Business from exploiting the workers while also preventing the workers from exploiting Big Business. The Fascists initially praised Roosevelt and the New Deal for defending labor, but gradually became critical when Roosevelt began heavily taxing Big Business. They saw this as perpetuating class conflict. \\n It should be noted that although the New Deal was influenced by Corporatism, there are a few reasons why it was  not Fascist . The biggest reason is that Roosevelt maintained our system of Parliamentary/Congressional Democracy, whereas the Fascists had a Syndicalist Democracy. Today, we widely believe that Fascism was anti-Democratic because they abolished political parties, but the truth is they replaced it with a variant of Syndicalism, which they called Corporatism. \\n TL;DR: Some polices from Roosevelt\\'s New Deal had been influenced by the Fascist Corporate State and survive to this day but Roosevelt refused to implement Fascist Syndicalism. \\n',\n  0),\n ('WHOA WHOA WHOA. \\n Let\\'s have a little American legal history lesson here. \\n In 1905, the US Supreme Court issued an opinion in  Lochner v. New York  which essentially said that New York could not establish a maximum work week for bakers. In the majority opinion, the Court essentially  invented a \"right to contract\"  derived from the 14th amendment. As such, the Court held that the individual\\'s right to contract under the 14th amendment trumped the state\\'s use of it\\'s police powers to regulate the health, safety and welfare of its citizens. \\n In 1937 however, the Supreme Court overturned  Lochner  by a 5-4 vote in its decision in  West Coast Hotel v. Parrish . In the majority opinion the Court reversed itself, stated that the 5th amendment did not guarantee a \"right to contract\" and instead held that the state could regulate private behavior so long as it had a compelling  \"state interest.\"  This precedent, while facing some push-back in recent years has held the force of law for the majority of the 20th century and remains  a cornerstone of American legal theory. \\n Flying directly in the face of /u/cassander\\'s narrative,  NONE  of the justices who took part in the decision in  West Coast Hotel  had been appointed by FDR. \\n But more importantly, most drug prohibition efforts took place on the  STATE level, not the federal level.  On the federal level, up until the mid-1960s, marijuana and other drugs were regulated only by  TAXES , not by out-right prohibition. As such, the Constitution under Art. 1 gives Congress the power to TAX. \\n What I believe /u/Cassander is possibly, and incorrectly, referring to is the current federal prohibition on drugs and the New Deal court\\'s broadening of the inter-state commerce clause. In 1942, SCOTUS issued a decision in the case of  Wickard v. Filburn . In the  Wickard  decision, the court dramatically expanded the  federal government\\'s ability to regulate commerce WITHIN the states  as well as its ability to regulate commerce BETWEEN the states. \\n While I personally believe that the court\\'s decision in  Wickard  was wrong and continues to be wrong, under  Marbury v. Madison , SCOTUS has the final say on \"what the law is.\" \\n TL;DR: Cassander\\'s comment confuses two very distinct issues. \\n 1) Drug prohibition, at least initially, took place on a state level and the states have the right to regulate drugs as they see fit. Moreover, calling absolute right to contract \"the legal old fashioned way\" is completely ignoring the evolutionary nature of the law and cultural norms surrounding government. \\n 2) While there is dispute over whether or not the federal government actually has the authority it should to implement a national drug policy, the court\\'s decision in  Wickard  remains good law and was cited as recently as 2005 in  Gonzales v. Raich . \\n Cassander\\'s answer is at best misleading and at worst blatant editorializing of history to fit political viewpoints. \\n Sources: \\n',\n  0),\n ('I guess you mean the end of the 19th century to beginning of the 20th century. \\n First of all let me say that the political climate in those years in Vienna was very conservative.  Karl Lueger  was Mayor of Vienna. He was of the Christian-Social Party which was an extremely conservative counterweight to the social democratic party that was emerging in Vienna. \\n The Austrian Empire at that time was already on the verge of collapse and was basically held together by the person of the  Emperor Franz Josef \\n Politics were extremely based on the ethnicity of the people and the Parliament had 23 Parties and 12 Independents for 516 seats in the end. (with the conservatives also having the majority). \\n So you cannot expect modernism, liberalism or modernist ideas from the political side. At least not at the time you are asking about. \\n So what is left ? \\n On a very basic level :  Art. \\n Why did that happen : \\n Well there is an anecdote that explains this a bit : When  Eduard van der Nüll  committed suicide after Franz Josef criticized him, this is to have really shocked the emperor and from then on he only said \"Es war sehr schön, es hat mich sehr gefreut\" (\"It was very beautiful, I liked it a lot\") when asked about his opinion about Art. In reality - Art probably didnt interest him that much, I think that he really couldn´t deal with the modern Forms of Art in any way (Compare your 75+ year old grandfather and his opinion about an iPad - yes very nice - but why do i need it). \\n But - and that is the important thing : He dind´t stop it. He let it run. He knew what could happen from [the revolt of 1848]( when censorship was to harsh, and i think he just didn\\'t really want to risk something like that again, especially in the very unstable state the country was in anyways. Basically he was saying : Why start a new problem, when you have already have a lot anyways. \\n And since the opinion of the emperor was - well maybe not the law - but really important such a non - committed position was actually quite benefical. \\n It opened up opportunities that just didn\\'t arise in states like (for example) Germany where Art was following the political will of the Emperor. \\n How far this went is easily shown: For example on  Michaelerplatz  would have spoken against it. (An anecdote tells us that after it was finished he never used this gate again to leave his palace) \\n And this attitude combined with relatively relaxed anti-obscenity laws (Vienna was the on of the porn capitals of the 19th century with one of the first exclusive pornographic film companies  Saturn Film  could work, and even had the backing of the political elite (Franz Josef was the first buyer of Klimts \"Das Werk Gustav Klimts\" (the ouvre of Gustav Klimt)). Also the [Seccession Movement]( gave a plattform for artists who didnt follow the Historicism movement that was the main for of pictural art at the time in Vienna. What was special about this is that other then the Berlin Seccesion for example, the Vienna Seccession didnt just welcome Artists who followed the \"Seccession Style\" but any modern artist who was accepted as \"worthy\" withing the artist circles could have an exhibition there, which made the cultural scene extremly rich. \\n Same same can be said for literature. This time was productive and the environment in Vienna made it possible for some of the greatest German speaking authors to work in Vienna. This ranged from people like  Schnitzler . \\n And last : Vienna at this time was a hotspot for political emigrants from all over Europe.  Cafe Central  (sorry had to take that from Wikipedia was too good to not include) \\n TL; DR: It was the location, the mixture of people, the political circumstances and the non intervention in cultural affairs from the highest authority that led to Vienna being such a hotspot of modern culture during the turn of the 19th to the 20th century. \\n',\n  0),\n ('The board rules linked on the right side of the page say \" our users aren’t here to do your homework for you, but they might be willing to help.\"  Board convention is usually to ignore or downvote posts like this, but I\\'m willing to offer some advice.

Use definitions already in place or establish a working definition of your own. \\n *While conceptions of Hellenic/Hellenistic identity certainly existed, AFAIK Greeks in antiquity saw themselves as members of their region/polis.

If anything I say is methodologically taboo, I absolutely welcome being told I\\'m wildly incorrect. \\n *Saying \"the fall\" seems inappropriate in this situation.

While Hellenic culture didn\\'t develop in a vacuum, Hellenistic culture incorporated a wider variety of influences.

One of the big ways he modernized dress was outlawing the fez and introducing European style hats (from the top hat to the fedora to the Irish immigrant cap); this was covered in the Hat Law of 1925.  Despite the fact that the fez was only introduced a century earlier in a previous Ottoman modernization attempt (to replace the turban), conservatives clung to it desperately and  in 1925, dozens of people were executed because they wore fezes (yes, fez the hat) .  See \"Kemalism on the Catwalk: The Turkish Hat Law of 1925\" by Camilla T.

This is due to the expense and rarity.  Thus, there weren't well coordinated firing drills.  People mostly shot their gun and reloaded at will.  So while the noise and sights of firing a gun were still impressive, gunners themselves were still vulnerable while reloading and in melee.  The Spanish and later replicated French tercio's attempted to remedy this by forming squares of pike-men with gunners in the center.  Gunners can quickly exit the square to fire and retreat back in the square during melee and cavalry charges.  It also had the added benefit of being easy to form in chaotic battlefield conditions, you follow the center flag with gunners in the middle and pike-men out. \\n Gustavus Adolphus, realized concentrated fire would allow a much stronger shock and awe effect.  Instead of having men being picked off slowly by individual gunners, he noted that a concentrated volley - having an entire line being chewed through by flying lead and metal - would have a devastating impact on enemy morale.  Imagine being part of a charge where a guy was dropping down from a gunshot every few seconds or one where every man two ranks deep in front of you dropped down screaming and bloodied.  One would terrify you much more than the other.  You're scared, you hesitate in your charge and that extra few seconds is all they need to reload and unleash another volley just like before.  This was part of a larger development in combined arms tactics with extensive use of field artillery, mass cavalry charges and more fluid infantry movement. \\n This leads to the predecessor of the Revolutionary War model of warfare wherein rows of men, backed by banners, drummers and drilled extensively to fire in volleys would attempt to break each others morale.  The sheer discipline instilled by coordinated reloading with music and banners would allow army lines to stand together better than a mob of gunners firing and reloading at their own leisure.  Especially since by the Revolutionary period the bayonet was common, providing the utility of an anti-cavalry spear and close quarter weapon, gunners were not as vulnerable in a melee so most forms of melee-only infantry were obsolete. \\n TL:DR - morale is everything and it was better than the alternative of shooting as you felt like it. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('WRT: Romans...That may have been the case for less organised(by Roman standards) \"barbarian\" forces like Gauls or Germanic tribes.

They were used to stab and gut from behind a wall of shields rather than to swing wildly. The training of the Roman legionary, the discipline of the legionary unit and the tactical flexibility of the army as a whole conveyed a significant advantage over even more numerous \"barbarian\" forces. \\n TLDR You wouldn\\'t often see a cluster of wild sword swinging from a roman unit unless that unit had broken down. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"My apologies for this wall of text that contains just one single cite to wikipedia, of all places. Hopefully a proper response will come along (but I imagine it would have to be from a legal academic) but in the meantime I will say that as a practical matter nullification was a non-issue in law school. It only came up as just one of the many ways that jurors can torpedo your case. \\n For better or worse, the average juror isn't viewed very favorably. There's an old joke that the only people on juries are the ones that weren't smart enough to get out of it. Nullification happens all the time but not in the sense that someone is rejecting a law they consciously disagree with. Rather, it happens when people subconsciously filter the case through the lens of biases and prejudices they brought with them to court. If a defendant is more like them than the plaintiff/state, chances are the defendant is getting their vote. \\n I don't think any lawyers will openly support nullification, partly because it directly contradicts the role we want jurors to play (mechanically apply the facts presented to the law, report your findings) but also because it adds one more subjective element to the system. The truth is there are enough moving parts that can introduce confusion and lawyers are pretty skeptical about the jury pool already. \\n tl;dr - its hard enough to get a jury to do their job correctly without providing them with a giant subjective trump card. \\n ninja edit - I satisfied my law school writing requirement with a paper arguing that consistent high-dollar verdicts in file-sharing cases could lead to nullification because of cases like  Jammie Thomas . \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"Food rationing did happen in the United States, but wasn't limited to the United States.

To the Soviet Union, their Great Patriotic War only started in 1941, not 1939. It was US and British involvement that really made it a global war (and it was the US who first called it WWII. Names of wars are very interesting ways to at what nations see the war as). Why was this the end to the \"30-years\" of violence?

No one was 100 percent certain (yes, even Foch) that there would be another worldwide military conflict on the scale of what they called \"The Great War\" and \"The War to End All Wars.\" \\n In fact, the Treaty of Versailles put forth many measures and promoted concepts to try and ensure that this  wouldn\\'t  happen: the League of Nations, self-determination, and a containment of communism are all good examples.  Obviously, these things created their own problems down the road, but we have the gift of hindsight to realize that.  In 1919, no one was quite sure what the future held, much like no one is really sure about the future today. \\n It\\'s also important to remember that the global financial collapse contributed greatly to the escalation towards war in Europe in the late 1930s/early 1940s.  The European and American economies were booming in the early-to-mid 1920s and labor movements were largely placated, as they got to keep many of the benefits they had won during the war.  Most production during this time was not military, but rather focused on consumer goods like automobiles and radios.  A good book for this is Charles Maier\\'s  Recasting Bourgeois Europe , which really captures how states were able to incorporate diverse elements to quickly recover from the devastation of war. \\n It\\'s important to remember that our view of these years is inherently tainted because we know the outcome.  We know that Adolf Hitler would eventually become a dictator and commit horrible atrocities, but in the 1920s him and German fascists were marginalized as paramilitary thugs in the climate of Weimar.  Only after the market crash and the onset of hyperinflation did their rhetoric attract a political following.  It\\'s important to understand the past on its own terms, not just our own. \\n TL:DR version : Was the war as we know it inevitable?  No, it could have looked very different.  Was conflict itself inevitable?  When is it not in history? \\n',\n  0),\n (\"I don't think you ever got an answer to this, so here's my understanding of the basics. I haven't prepared so it won't be perfectly accurate but it's better than nothing. \\n Religion is old, and many of the most famous stories and gods are borrowed by newer societies as they replace the older ones. An example of this is that throughout a huge number of ancient religious groups there is a myth about a great flood of some kind, probably stemming from an event in modern day Iraq thousands of years ago, but which we would be most familiar today as the story of Noah's Ark. Another would be the fact that pretty much every Western and Middle Eastern polytheistic religion has some form of Lightning/War God (like Thor, or Zeus) that was the ruler of them all due to his unrivalled power. Usually its just cultural osmosis and no-one really thinks twice about it, but that's what was happening long before the Greeks. \\n The Greeks emerged around 800 BC and slowly began to learn pottery and writing after a huge Bronze Age collapse of previous civilisations. About 300 years before, the eastern Mediterranean world had been dominated by Mycenaean, Egyptian and Hittite empires, and then they all declined rapidly about the same time, most collapsed. If I remember rightly the currently suspected cause is the violent arrival of Indo-European peoples that eventually became us. So the Greeks emerged as one of the few civilised groups around, having had plenty of time and plenty of old sources to draw their colourful religion from. As they grew and ran out of land, they began to colonise the Mediterranean basin, from Spain to the Crimea - and most importantly for us, Italy. \\n When the Latin people emerged, had their kings and broke into a republic, they were influenced by those around them, the Etruscans and such, but also by the great powers in the background. Everyone would know at least a little about the proud Greeks, and due to the colonisation would be familiar with their gods. Following the typical practice of borrowing bits of other religions, the Romans were very influenced by the Greeks, particularly noting that some of their most important gods (of War, Fertility, other basic and inevitably popular gods) were essentially the same as the Greek counterparts, and so they merged them. They had a huge array of their own gods, with a rich tapestry of stories, traditions and ideas, but the top gods became copies of the Greeks. \\n Oh, and finally: You were taught that the Greeks were peaceful, the Romans were warriors and their gods are identical not necessaries because your teacher is bad, but because s/he has to simplify it. I'm sure it kills them to simplify centuries of history into a couple of words, but depending on the curriculum... you gotta do what you gotta do. Don't even mention it to them, take it upon yourself to browse books or Wikipedia to fill in the gaps. Hope this helped! \\n TL;DR Romans and Greeks shared several important and basic gods because how many unique stories can you make about a goddess of fertility anyway? But they had their own unique gods too. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('To be frank, I think it\\'s hyperbole. I\\'m sorry, the following is confusing, but Italian politics never was anything other than complicated. \\n Granted, Cosimo did have a ton of influence, it\\'s said he was the one of the factors that helped to make Francesco Sforza the duke of Milan. It could be said that Cosimo ruled Florence indirectly. [I guess that would be the peak of their power]. \\n Let\\'s look at Lorenzo, son of Cosimo. Even with his vast wealth, and the remaining influence from his father, he nearly was murdered in a civil-war-like attack (his brother was killed), which can show us that his control of the city wasn\\'t so firm. He was an able propagandist, as we can see by the accounts of his contemporaries; the power of the Medici was already waning, but his patronage for the arts made a good facade over that. He somehow wasn\\'t able or willing to put an end to the rise of Savonarola. \\n Which brings us to Piero, son of Lorenzo. When the French came marching through, the Medici had to flee Florence and Savonarola came to rule the town. He died in exile. \\n Another son of Lorenzo was Guiliano Medici, who was made Cardinal - which wasn\\'t that extraordinary for a cleric of \"good family\", and later even got to be pope. Through political maneuvering, he made Lorenzo II. Medici, a son of Piero, to be duke of Urbino.\\nFunnily enough, through ecclesial politics and not through their economical influence, the Medici even managed to become the dukes of Florence. \\n Guilio Medici, he was a cousin of Guiliano, was made  pope after the successor of Guiliano (Hadrian VI) died. The political situation somehow allowed him to make Alessandro (who is rumored to be his own son, but de jure was a son of Lorenzo II. Medici) the duke of Florence. And now comes the masterpiece. One daughter of Lorenzo II. Caterina married the duke of Orléans, who rose to be king of France. She went on to be Queen-Regent, her sons to be kings, and her daughter to be queen. \\n TL, DR: Real political power only came to the Medici through ecclesial politics. Their wealth really helped with getting a foot into the vatican, but ultimatively couldn\\'t buy them any \"real\" titles. Certain individuals of the family were influencial before that, but their influence and power proved to be only temporary. \\n',\n  0),\n ('No ancient religions had the geographic spread of modern religions; there were major regional religions, or groups of religions, which claimed large followings in more restricted (rarely cross-continental) areas. \\n Zoroastrianism has been brought up; it\\'s not completely dead, but it was a major religion in Persia, and heavily influenced the development of the Abrahamic religions. \\n In Europe, the Greek pantheon gave rise to the Roman pantheon; the two of them would have been widely spread throughout the Mediterranean, and into Europe following Roman influence. \\n Similarly, in Northern Europe, the Norse pantheon dominated Scandinavia, much of pre-Christian Germany, and the areas of the British Isles settled/influenced by the Angles/Saxons/Jutes/Danes/Norse.  The Pantheons were slightly different; for example, Friday is named for Frigg, not Freyja, and the two Goddesses may or may not have been the same or different among various Germanic tribes.  However, the religions of many of the Germanic and Norse tribes would have been similar, and dominated Northern Europe and the Baltic until they were displaced by Christianity. \\n Again, these would have been major religions (or families of religions) in their time.  Bear in mind Christianity was a localized European phenomenon until imperialism and colonialism spread it to the Americas and beyond; Islam spread along trading routes, and spanned into China and Southeast Asia, becoming one of the most geographically widespread religions (alongside Buddhism, though Buddhism just happened to be in India/China/Southeast Asia, a large but contiguous \"local\" region). \\n TL;DR No.  No religion in history has had comparable reach to Christianity of Islam today.  The scales are completely different. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Okay, no. No, no, no, no. No war is ever a \"good guy vs. bad guy\" sort of thing from a historical perspective, though individual nations by and large choose to cast the war they\\'re fighting in that sense. You can bet World War II was seen by citizens of the Axis powers as a \"good vs. evil\" affair, just as certainly as you can bet that they didn\\'t see themselves on the \"evil\" side. \\n The truth of the matter is that history really is, to raise the old cliche, \"written by the victors\". Or at least by those left alive to write it. Retrospect allows us to see the horrors of the Holocaust or the unspeakably brutal after-effects of the Eastern or Chinese or Philippine Fronts, but it\\'s probably safe to say that the majority of German conscripts fighting at, say, Kursk, were not there so that their leaders could continue to exterminate millions of innocent civilians in frighteningly efficient fashion. \\n tl;dr: No war is ever \"good vs. evil\"; individuals and nations just choose to cast it that way. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"The truth is that WW1 wasn't fought over anything in particular. Perhaps the only belligerents that had any real reason to go to war were the Serbians who wanted to remain free of direct Austro-Hungarian control and the Austro-Hungarians who wanted to control the Serbians (in a manner of speaking). The other parties had a variety of reasons which I'll cover below. \\n War had been coming for a long time before the actual event. The arms race between Great Britain and Germany resulted to the development of the Dreadnought and increased tensions between the two nations. The intricate treaties and alliances saw Germany surrounded by Triple Entente powers. Obviously this left Germany feeling threatened and coupled with the existing German military tradition, preparations for war were inevitable. \\n France had territorial ambitions. It had been humiliated by Germany in the Franco-Prussian War and was forced to cede the territories of Alsace-Lorraine to the Prussians.  Russia is probably the more interesting. It had no real interest in joining the war and only did so because of Serbia's plea that Russia aid its Slavic brethren. Following German unification, Russia feared German military intentions and so agreed to an alliance with France, encircling Germany. \\n Italy really had no reason whatsoever. It had initially been aligned with Germany and the Austro-Hungarians but withdrew when hostilities broke out. It eventually joined the Entente and spent most of the war getting its butt handed to it. The British were part of the Entente but only entered the war after Germany violated Belgian neutrality. I don't recall reading anything about it, but I suspect the British were also suspicious of German colonial ambitions and with the High Seas Fleet, Germany had the naval power to threaten British colonial possessions abroad. \\n The Ottoman Empire only entered the conflict after initial hostilities had broken out and only did so because war would have provided a nice distraction to its domestic issues of which it had many. The Empire also didn't really care who it allied with, it approached the Russians but refused Russian demands that would have effectively placed parts of the Ottoman Empire under Russian control, the British also refused. Germany on the other handed needed an ally in the Middle East. The Ottomans could threaten British interests which would tie up British forces (which it did) and also had the potential to threaten Russia (which it did to some extent). \\n tl,dr: the reasons that the different belligerents entered the war were varied and all served national interests. None can be labeled good or evil. \\n Edit: a word \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"Generally speaking, I think you overemphasize the support given by Americans to European democratic revolutionaries. As much as they liked to trumpet the values of republicanism and equate their independence movements to the  spirit  of 1776 (see the Young America movement especially), they always backed off from saying that any movement really compared with the American Revolution (think exceptionalism). This lesson had been learned early on with the French Revolution in 1789; initially it had looked so promising but with its descent into violence came American reluctant to believe that Europeans were really capable of the type of republicanism Americans had achieved. For more generalized analysis of this idea, check out Michael Hunt's  Ideology and US Foreign Policy . \\n An excellent example of this point and my overall argument is Louis (Lajos) Kossuth himself. Read American newspapers and you'll hear thunderous applause (the writing is so forceful that you might literally hear it) for him and everything he stands for in his fight against oppressive Austrian and Russian forces...until anyone gets wind of how he's treating ethnic minorities in Hungary. Suddenly he's not so illustrious anymore, certainly worthy of admiration but not quite up to the American par. Only devoted Young Americans refused to say anything against him. \\n Then, like you say, he's freed from Turkish prison (I'll refrain from an  Airplane!  reference here) and brought to the US on an American warship. Real thunderous applause this time. Over 250,000 people greet him in New York. He tries to speak but they're so happy that he's drowned out by the crowd. As he tries to leave, people are cutting away bits of his clothing as souvenirs (not making this stuff up, it's in the NY Times). But applause is pretty much where it ends. He spends the next year or so touring the US asking for money to continue his revolution. He meets with President Fillmore and, like you said, is the first foreigner since Lafayette himself to be formally welcomed to the halls of Congress. The government refuses to get involved, more than anything else in order to continue the spirit of Washington's Farewell Address. Overall, the American public won't budge either. American support for revolutionary movements stopped at words, even when a beloved (perhaps the most beloved) revolutionary is standing right before them with his hand out. It's not that Americans didn't love republicanism or European attempts at it. It's that no one could do it as well as Americans, enough to warrant support and break the nation's tradition of neutrality. Kossuth spent more money on the tour than he made, and left the US in disgrace in 1852. \\n There's surprisingly little historiography about Kossuth and his tour specifically. The best book-length treatment I've seen (and pretty much the only one since it was published in 1977) is Donald Spencer's  Louis Kossuth and Young America: A Study of Sectionalism and Foreign Policy 1848-52 . \\n TL;DR Kossuth's example shows how much US support for Europe in 1848 was lip service and nothing else. American exceptionalism ensured that European republicanism wasn't good enough in American eyes. And America's refusal to help, even when asked outright and up close, shows that their professed support was a house of cards. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('Yes, the British used heavy machine guns for indirect fire. And their use in this role was quite common, for most of the reasons you state. Casualties, harassment, and disruption. \\n Breaking down why; essentially different calibers of machine guns have different uses. The light Lewis and Hotchkiss guns (two to four men crew) are designed to work with small units of troops; they are man-portable, with feeding designs meant for quick re-loading by people carrying magazines. The medium/heavy Vickers gun (six to eight men) is a water-cooled, not particularly portable refinement on the old Maxim gun. All three of these guns are chambered in .303, the standard British rifle round, simplifying logistics. This is a large, powerful round, quite capable of travelling over the horizon (the 7mm Mauser round has a flatter trajectory and a longer range still). \\n There are a couple of reasons for indirect fire from the heavy Vickers - tactically speaking, it allowed the Vickers to fire suppressing and harassing rounds at over twice the distance that line-of-sight achieved. The effective range of direct fire - flat trajectory while an enemy could be seen - was roughly 2 kilometers. However indirect fire - pointing the muzzle of the gun upward, firing in an arc to land atop an enemy - could reach back over 4, clear over terrain. While high explosive artillery rounds have their charms, it is also expensive, churns up ground, and is often unavailable. \\n Operationally, indirect fire was a luxury afforded when the Hotchkiss and Lewis guns appeared on the scene in numbers great enough. The Vickers gun crews and their weapons were able to be removed from the Infantry and grouped into their own Corps. This was designed to mass firepower in more effective ways, and coordinate machine guns across the whole army. Suddenly there were battalions of Vickers which could be employed in this way. \\n TL:DR Opportunity and equipment. \\n',\n  0),\n ('This is going off largely what I remember from my French history class and what information is available at the museum I work at part time, which covers the Lewis and Clark expedition. If anything seems unclear, feel free to ask. If anything seems wrong, feel free to correct. \\n France, specifically Napoleon, was already pressured enough without Jefferson needing to do much. Around 1803, Britain and France seemed to be at the verge of war (again). The Louisiana territory was hugely coveted by many countries at the time, mainly for the port city of New Orleans, and thus access the very successful trade routes based around the Mississippi river. Britain and America especially wanted it. Even though he had happily aquired it only a while before, Napoleon quickly found himself spread out a bit thin across the globe. He was preparing to invade Britain, which is no easy feat considering their navy. He couldn\\'t spare the thousands of troops required to protect Louisiana.  Selling the Louisiana territory to Jefferson would solve two problems right away: America would be the ones to defend that territory, and if the British wanted it, they would probably find themselves on a \"two front\" war as it were (assuming that, remembering their help from the Revolutionary war, America would ally with France.) Second, he could relatively quickly get a lot of money to fund his upcoming campaigns. Jefferson gave him about $15 million for it, which is over $200 million today. There was also the problems Napoleon was having in the Caribbean at the time. There was a massive and very successful slave revolt in Saint-Domingue (Haiti) that he tried to crush, and when that failed, reconquer. That didn\\'t work either, and he lost a sufficient income from the sugar trade there, which is another reason why he couldn\\'t financially hold Louisiana and wanted to sell it. \\n Now onto Jefferson. While many presidents didn\\'t particularly like the Natives and would force them Westward (I\\'m looking at you Jackson), Jefferson wasn\\'t really proactive in forcing them out. Americans did most of the work as we continued to push West. Besides, forcing the natives into Louisiana wouldn\\'t work much anyway, considering that they were a major part of the trade routes, especially in fur trading. There\\'s a long history of French-Native American trade, mostly from Canada down along the Mississippi, so more wouldn\\'t be much of a problem, it would just mean more chances for trade. As far as foreign policies, Jefferson was an isolationist, or rather, non-involvement-ist. As he said, \"Commerce with all nations, alliance with none.\" Trade with Europe = awesome, politics/war/drama with Europe = bad. So does it make sense that he jumped at the chance to more than double America\\'s size and gain a large and valuable trade route, even if it meant dealing briefly with Europe? Yes. Would he actively fight for it by getting involved with Europe\\'s drama? No. Sending a couple of diplomats to France (Robert Livingston and future president James Monroe) was about as pushy as he got. \\n It\\'s also interesting to note that Jefferson later felt that by buying Louisiana, he was actually going against the Constitution. He felt that Congress should have made the major decisions, not him. Although, Livingston and Monroe were actually the ones who made the preliminary agreement. \\n tl;dr Most likely false, Napoleon didn\\'t need any extra forcing, Jefferson wasn\\'t that pushy anyway. \\n Further reading: \\nMonticello\\'s official website has a great article on it here: \\n Here are photo copies from the Library of Congress of several relevant documents to the Purchase as well: \\n',\n  0),\n ('Invented as a literary device by Robert Lewis Stevenson, long after the golden age of Caribbean piracy.

The oldest guns were invented in the early 12th century. Primitive guns like the Chinese \"fire lance\" or \"fire spear\" were descendants of earlier incendiary weapons. The ability to fire projectiles was really only a secondary feature that  gradually  overtook the original function of projecting a stream of fire.  The earliest guns came into existence from soldiers who experimented with existing incendiary weapons by placing metal or clay pellets inside the barrels. It would take decades for guns to transform into weapons that solely fired projectiles. \\n Guns from the 12th and 13th centuries were also notoriously slow and inaccurate. They had a limited firing range and duration, and did not fare well against the speed of mounted steppe cavalry like those of the Mongols. It was because of these disadvantages that primitive guns were far less common on the battlefield than the crossbows of the Song Chinese or the composite bows of the Mongols. Having guns did little to deter invasions by the Mongols. It wasn\\'t until around the mid 13th century that guns, which had previously been constructed from bamboo and paper, began transitioning into metal barrels that more closely resemble modern guns. It took over a century for the gun to change from an incendiary weapon used against siege weapons that happened to fired projectiles to a weapon with an iron barrel and high-nitrate gunpowder capable of only firing projectiles. \\n Even then, the gun was not able to replace the bow or the crossbow. It took another series of inventions in Europe, like corning (which prevented gunpowder from spoiling) and the matchlock, for the gun to really come into its own. The matchlock arquebus was invented in 15th century Europe, three centuries after the first appearance of the gun. The corned gunpowder of the matchlock arquebus greatly increased the velocity, range, and deadliness of the bullets fired from the gun. Incidentally, the English word \"arquebus\" comes ultimately comes from the German word \"hakebusse\" or \"hook gun\". German cities were one of the major centers for the manufacturing of arquebuses. \\n But tl;dr, it took centuries of gradual advances for the gun to progress to its current stage and guns did not immediately replace bows. \\n Weapons and Warfare in Renaissance Europe: Gunpowder, Technology, and Tactics  by Bert Hall \\n Firearms: A Global History to 1700  by Kenneth Chase \\n A History of Greek Fire and Gunpowder  by J.R.

For them, the three greatest musicians who represented all that was great about German music were Ludwig van Beethoven, Richard Wagner, and Anton Bruckner. \\n Bruckner\\'s music was played at important events, and they were very fond of his music and his image. [Here\\'s a picture of Hitler unveiling a bust of Bruckner]( at Regensburg in June 1937. [Here\\'s Joseph Goebbels\\' Address at Regensburg]( \\n Why were they fond of good old Anton? Well, he was born in Austria, from a family of \"simple people.\" He was not a child prodigy and didn\\'t really become a super star in his life time. He kept his head down, worked hard, and didn\\'t particularly great recognition in his lifetime. Unlike other famous composers, he was not a megalomaniac asshole, he was apparently humble. He became famous after his death (and the nazis kind of helped getting his music played more often). This fits with nazi propaganda: An Austrian guy who came from humble roots, worked hard, and took the German greatness to new heights, leaving the people an amazingly great legacy without while keeping his humility. Yep, good Adolf... I mean, Anton... Yep, Bruckner made a good poster boy. The nazis used his image and touched up his biography to fit their agenda. \\n Now, why his music? Well, Bruckner composed massive orchestral music, which is a very German thing. Great composer of symphonies, with a mostly conservative taste (even if there are some peculiarities in his music). Bruckner was very fond of Wagner, and studied his music a lot. You know who else was a super fan of Wagner? Hitler. \\n Bruckner wasn\\'t super famous in his lifetime, and he had quite a few critics. See, there was the so-called  War of the Romantics . I think the nazis twisted that later to say the enemies of German greatness conspired to avoid his success (guess who those enemies would be?) \\n Why use that particular music for the announcement? Bruckner worked in that symphony between 1881 and 1885. It is dedicated to Ludwig II of Bavaria, a fan of extravagant art and architecture and the biggest Wagner groupie ever.  Bruckner wrote the second movement for Wagner as some kind of tribute, fearing Wagner would die soon (he did die soon after he started working). He included [Wagner tubas]( in his orchestration. \\n That Adagio has the indication Sehr feierlich und sehr langsam (Very solemnly and very slowly). And it can be considered solemn, sad, dramatic, powerful music. Composed in an unmistakably German style, originally for a very influential German genius, who Bruckner admired a lot. It was meant to be a respectful and sober homage, I guess we can agree it gives that vibe. \\n The Adagio was played before announcing the defeat at Stalingrad, and then to announce Hitler\\'s death. [Apparently the recording used was conducted by Furtwängler]( So, listening to THAT music again, after a lot of super dramatic Wagner and frequent calls to attention... It was obvious something VERY VERY VERY BIG had happened. \\n Were there other possibilities other than Hitler\\'s death? I don\\'t know, I leave that to the people knowledgeable of WWII history. \\n Some words about Bruckner\\'s music after the nazis. \\n Bruckner\\'s life and music was studied, and the stuff the nazis tried to make up/revise was discovered. His status in the orchestral canon was maintained or even increased. He might not be a household name like Beethoven, but his music is extremely common in the concert hall and most people attending symphony concerts will recognize his name and music (not to mention any music student of the last 4 decades). He is as representative of symphonic music as it can get. \\n Unlike Wagner, Bruckner and his music have not been associated with nazism and/or antisemitism. Wagner was vocal about his antisemitic ideas, and many other things (kind of a megalomaniac and an asshole). As far as I know Bruckner never expressed anything of that sort. Wagner\\'s music has not been well received in Israel, but as far as I know they have had no problem with Bruckner. \\n In the last decades no respectable/sane conductor/orchestra would omit his symphonies. Bruckner\\'s music was not particularly popular in Austria during his life, but they fully embrace his music now. \\n TL;DR \\n The nazis liked Bruckner and his music very much. They had used the same music to announce the defeat at Stalingrad, and it was kind of natural to assume something big had happened after listening to a lot of dramatic Wagner and that specific Bruckner. \\n',\n  0),\n ('I\\'m currently researching new religious movements in Korea, circa 1860s, and I just finished reading [a book that contains records from Christian missionaries]( going to Korea and declaring the place \"without religion,\" despite the presence of several spiritual traditions. The exclusive characteristic of religion is really a Western concept - one can\\'t be Christian  and  Buddhist, because that would negate the whole \"thou shalt have no others gods before me\" part of monotheistic religions. But this is a bit more fluid in Asian religions. A lot of the \"religions\" you mentioned are practiced more like \"traditions,\" and there\\'s no emphasis on proselytizing. \\n Today, in surveys on religious affiliation, many people in Asia would say that they are Catholic or secular or Muslim or whatever they are, but still participate in rituals on certain holidays or forms of ancestor worship or whatever has been happening in their family for generations. Anecdotal, but illustrative: my husband\\'s family in Korea are Christian (his uncle is a pastor), but the whole family still celebrates Buddha\\'s birthday, maintains ancestral graves, and donates to Buddhist shrines before big events (births, tests, job interviews). These \"religious practices\" are basically family and cultural traditions that don\\'t negate their Christian faith at all. So although they mark \"Christian\" on a census, an outside observer would rightfully point out that most of them visit Buddhist shrines more than their Christian church. \\n As for some of the specific religions you mentioned... Confucianism is more of a code of ethics and social rules rather than a religion. It coexists easily with other traditions because it has no spiritual doctrine, really, except perhaps some aspects of ancestor worship. This is most simply demonstrated by the fact that the Chinese Communist Party has built \"Confucian Institutes\" to facilitate cultural learning abroad. Confucianism can coincide with secularism because it isn\\'t really religion. \\n I wish I could tell you more about Shinto, but my knowledge of Japan is pretty much confined to the colonial period, so I really only know how it was applied in Korea post-1910. Shinto was state religion in Japan, and really closely tied with Japanese nationalism. From reading that I\\'ve done, I get the impression that Shinto was chosen to be the state religion because it was an indigenous Japanese practice rather than the number of followers it had. I know some Korean shamanistic rituals were redressed as Shintoism in the early twentieth century with little fuss, which goes to show that the  rituals  were the important part, and it didn\\'t matter much what the associated religion was called. \\n With all of that said , there is still a long history of religious violence in Asia, although usually these conflicts were over political issues rather than doctrinal/religious ones. In Korea, there is a history of bloody repression of  Catholics  - although this was perpetrated by the state over perceived political subversion, and not religious conflict, per se. Buddhism, of course, comes to mind as well. The popular image of the \"warrior monk\" comes from the Buddhist tradition, and Buddhist temples historically have had a lot of power - some owned land, had armies, appointed officials, etc. More recently, Buddhist conflict with Muslim groups (in Burma, Sri Lanka, Thailand, etc.) are gaining attention, in particular due to suicide bombings and other terror attacks. \\n TLDR: Non-monotheistic religions play well with others. Religious violence in Asia tends to happen in conflict with the state rather than other religions, with recent exceptions. \\n',\n  0),\n ('What was futile about going over the top? The battles of trench warfare were quite bloody, but it must be said that in terms of casualty rates the battles of mobile warfare, in 1914, 1918 and on the eastern front were VASTLY more bloody. \\n In 1915 the French were able to achieve a break-in of the German lines at the Second Battle of Artois; soldiers of the XXXIII (?) Colonial corps captured Vimy Ridge, and it was only the failure of reserves to reach them that led to their being pushed back. Similarly, at Neuve Chapelle and Loos, British troops were very close to making at least a modest breakthrough. \\n At the Somme in 1916, the French took all of their objectives on the first day, and for the rest of the battle enjoyed consistent success against the German Army. XIII and XV Corps of the British Fourth Army also took their objectives, and the British were subsequently able to capture important ground, and inflict great losses on their enemies. Similarly, the French held their ground at Verdun, and under Robert Nivelle went on the offensive, taking back the ground they had lost. \\n At Arras in 1917, the British enjoyed even greater success; More ground was captured than in any other British offensive before, while the Canadian Corps took Vimy Ridge. Messiness Ridge was a stunning success, and even in the Battle of Third Ypres the British could say that they had inflicted great losses on their foe, seized Passchenadele-Staden Ridge, and I\\'d say come quite close to a breakthrough. \\n Similarly with the French; the Nivelle Offensive DID in fact lead to the French Army mutinies, but it did succeed in capturing parts of the formidable Chemin Des Dames Ridge. This lay the seeds for a stunning French victory at La Malmaison, which completed the capture of this formidable German position. \\n As to needless slaughter, I\\'ll leave you this answer that I posted earlier in an ANZAC question (hence the references to Australia and New Zealand): \\n >The losses make me sick to my stomach as well. With hindsight, I can see that mistakes were made and could have been avoided, as could some casualties, but in light of communications difficulties, the fickle nature of new technologies, and the general fog/friction of war, I can understand why mistakes, when they were actually made, were made. In the end, casualties are unavoidable in war; WWI was no exception. It should also be emphasized here that it wasn\\'t easy BEING a commander, either an officer or a general. By the end of 1914, the Austro-Hungarian Officer Corps had suffered 50% losses, and losses among British Staff Officers were so bad that they were ordered NOT to go to the Front (most ignored this). 86 German, 78 British and at least 47 French Generals died for their countries in the Great War, and yet their kind are reviled as cowardly, repugnant human beings today. \\n >However, one must ask oneself why they were fighting. Britain could not standby and allow Germany to exert hegemony over the continent, the High Seas Fleet resting in the Channel ports like a gun pointed at Britain\\'s head. The Dominions relied on Britain for security and economic enterprises, and any threat to Britain was a threat to that empire of which they were a part. This was more pressing for the Aussies and the Kiwis, in light of German possessions in Samoa, the Mariannas and Marshalls, and Kaiser Wilhelm\\'s Land, and the rising power of Japan. \\n >As for the continent, was it not right for Belgium to be able to decide it\\'s future, to remain an independent state and not be partially annexed or made an economic vassal as the Germans intended? How about the French? Was it not right to prevent the Germans from subjugating that country, the home of millions of \\'Poilus\\', fellow soldiers of the French Army? \\n >There\\'s an Australian Historian that I recommend you look into; he died years ago, but his name was Trevor Wilson. He was no defender of the Generals, as his and his colleague Robin Prior\\'s books on the Somme and Passchendaele can attest! In 1986, he published one of the best accounts of the British experience in WWI I\\'ve ever read, called \\'Myriad Faces of War\\'. In the final section he asked that, if the First World War cannot apparently be dubbed a \\'good war\\', unlike WWII, can it not at least be considered one of \\'Freedom\\'s Battles\\'? Would the democracies/mostly democracies of Britain, France, Italy and America, even the peoples of Russia, not pay a terrible forfeit in the event of a Central Powers Victory? Would not Democracy in Europe have been greatly curtailed, even more so than it was, by a triumphant Kaiserreich? Was there  REALLY   so little at stake,  as most people assume? \\n >Food for thought! :) I\\'ll leave you with the final passage of his book, which references Field-Marshall Haig\\'s \\'Backs to the Wall\\' despatch, posted below: \\n > \\n >\"This might be dismissed as the empty rhetoric of an impoverished command.

A passage in the radical periodical the Nation, quoted on a previous occasion, deserves repetition here. Massingham wrote: \\n > In the full brunt of the German assault on France, the true character of the war stands revealed. Vain projects of imperialism obscured it, and vainer diversions of strategy. Both have disappeared... the war emerges from these mists not as a war of adventure, but morally and physically as a war of defence....

In short, despite their great differences in background and outlook, each was prepared to claim that this was in truth one of freedom\\'s battles. \\n >Perhaps in so perceiving the conflict, the traditionalist Field-Marshall and the radical journalist were both deluded. \\n >Perhaps, on the other hand, they were not.\" \\n TL;DR:  They didn\\'t rebel (at least not frequently) because they had a job to do (ie win the war) and most believed it was a job that needed to be done. \\n',\n  0),\n ('To start off, we\\'re talking about a group of people that were given weapons and then generally put above the law. This presented temptations not every man could resist. \\n At any rate, let\\'s have a quick look at knighthood. From about the 9th century onwards, we see the concept of knights develop as an answer to the military challenges posed by the Vikings, among others. The early knights were simply men who were given the means to afford expensive weaponry and the time to train for combat, in exchange for military service when called upon by their lord. Over the centuries, this develops into a lifestyle that certainly has some aspects of an ideology. An important aspect of this is the Crusades, as the idea of the Milites Christi (Soldier/knight of Christ) which explicitly combines the idea of knighthood and moral behaviour. A lot of this is about proper interaction between knights and noblemen outside of the battlefield (because while there are famous exceptions, people who\\'ve seen raving madmen with big swords rush at them in a murderous rage, tend to understand that on the battlefield anything goes), which is, btw, not entirely unlike what the maffia is like, according to the movies. You owe allegiance to a superior, who has responsibilities for you and serves as a way of distributing wealth among you and your peers. The mechanism for this is a mutual practice of gift giving, and occasionally something like taxes. There\\'s a lifestyle that  needs  to be maintained for people to be considered knights, which is a requirement that puts a lot of financial pressure on the knightly class, especially in times of economic hardship. \\n From about the 14th century onwards, however, we see that with pikemen and firearms, large groups of cheaply equiped and badly trained get more and more of a military upper hand over small groups of highly trained and expensively equiped knights. And as knights start losing their position as the core of any military effort, the ideology of knighthood starts losing its connection to reality, which leads to the kind of things that are being mocked in Don Quixote. \\n For interesting literature with the knightly ideology as its context, look at \"Karel ende Elegast\" (I\\'m sure there\\'s an English translation), or to a lesser degree stories about King Arthur as written by Monmouth. \\n Tl;dr: there\\'s some reality and a lot of fiction. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"I think I can answer this, or at least expand upon your theory due to philosophy never really having an answer. As modern ideals evolve so to does modern fighting. However in a modern society which generally draws away from violence on every level we have also forgotten how to fight. The idea of lining up and shooting at each other has never really left the modern battlefield (where western countries are involved) the technology has changed. But if somewhere we didn't believe that lining up and shooting each other wouldn't work we wouldn't have tanks. Because that's all they really do. We have discovered as a modern world that buying and trading is a more complete way to defeat a country, Asia (very basically and very simplistically) owns the US and could bring the global economy to it's knees if it wanted to. Game over, no shots fired, but we (western military's) are still training and planning to fight a war like this. Against a country. With battle lines, and different uniforms. Which is why when we go up against a country like Vietnam, or Afghanistan, or Iraq. We lose, because we don't know how to fight and it scares the populous (western) that that is actually what their (western) military is trained for. Now the guys we are fighting in these countries know how to fight. They grew up with guns, not like in suburban US where every one has them, but like inner city US where people have and use them. They know if a guy comes up to you with a tank, leave. They know that Hummers and LAVs are targets and if you IED one people come out of them. And People can be shot. When Canada went to Afghanistan we learned quickly that LAVs were targets, so we started walking everywhere. All the time. We were friendly to people we met and all of a sudden the guerrillas had to fight on the same level as us, and it wasn't a fair fight. We train for ambush on foot, we don't train for how not to get shot running out of a LAV. When had to re-learn how to fight, and forget how to be an army. Our Navy did the same thing in Libya, we watched a guerrilla campaign from start to finish. While the French and the British tried to shoot anything that moved we listen, we learned and only supplementing the technology the rebels had with our own we managed to change out littoral (Navy for guerrilla, kind of) doctrine. Your notion is right, western society has changed and affected our ability to defeat a-symmetric forces. But it's because we don't really know how to fight anymore because we still fight like it's British redcoats v. Napoleon's French, just with better tech. \\n TLDR: The west doesn't know how to fight anymore. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"I am excite incarnate--finally a chance to use knowledge garnered from the writing of my stupidly obscure master's thesis! \\n To simplify it, yes, Spain didn't join in the Axis because the civil war had wrecked the country, although of course there were additional complications.  Franco and the Falange (especially Ramón Serrano Suñer) were enthusiastic supporters of Hitler's regime, and wanted in on that war.  Ultimately, they stayed out because the Germans bungled the negotiations, largely because of interference from ideologues at the top of the German Foreign Office (Ribbentrop, etc.). \\n The Germans made two big mistakes.  One, they underestimated how badly the civil war (and Franco's subsequent economic policies) had damaged the Spanish economy.  Franco wanted German economic aid to commence before entering the war because he and his government saw this as vital to preparing Spain for the war.  Without German aid, they were convinced, Spain simply could not enter the war prepared to actually fight. \\n The Germans, being already engaged in the war and needing all the resources they could get, refused to deliver any material or financial aid until Spain actually entered the war.  The German Foreign Office took the position that Spain was deliberately overstating the damage done to their economy.  The German ambassador to Spain, Eberhard von Stohrer, argued that the Spanish position was probably closer to the truth than not, but Berlin ignored him. \\n Edit: Another thing worth mentioning is that the Germans didn't particularly care  that  much about Spain's potential military contributions, so from their perspective, they didn't have a lot to gain by investing hugely in the Spanish economy during wartime.  By this point, France had surrendered, and the UK looked pretty isolated.  Perhaps the Germans' biggest motivation was to build a coalition of sufficient size to convince the UK to give up without a protracted fight.  Remember, at this point Hitler was already starting to look east again. \\n The second major mistake was a set of demands that infringed upon Spanish sovereignty, a pretty huge mistake considering that A) Franco himself was a huge nationalist and B) Spain at the time was ruled by a quasi-fascist coalition that didn't see eye to eye on a lot of issues, but was united by--you guessed it--extreme nationalism (and anti-communism, but this wasn't really an issue here).  In German military plans, Spain's entry into the war was to coincide with an assault on Gibraltar.  German planners frankly didn't think that Spanish troops, even with training and German equipment, could pull the attack off, and intended to do it with German troops, which in turn upset the Spanish. \\n Also, Germany wanted territorial concessions from Spain, and refused to guarantee specifically what colonial concessions Spain would receive from France after Axis victory (after all, the Germans were courting Vichy France at the time as well).  In particular, the Germans wanted Spanish islands in the Atlantic to use as bases, and refused to accept Franco's offer to allow them use--as friends and allies--of Spanish facilities.  IIRC, they also wanted some land in Spanish Africa for similar purposes.  Franco, an extreme nationalist and an  africanista , was loath to part with any Spanish territory, and the Germans simply would not drop it. \\n Ultimately, the Germans felt Spain was dicking them around, got pissed, and delivered a really pissy ultimatum.  Stohrer tried to get them to tone it down, but Berlin insisted he read it to Franco verbatim.  It included such gems as, \\n >The Führer and the Reich Government are deeply disturbed by the equivocal and vacillating attitude of Spain. This attitude is completely incomprehensible to them both in view of the help which they gave Franco in the Spanish Civil War and in view of the crystal-clear political interest of Spain in an alignment with Germany and her allies.  (DGFP, ser. D, XI, no. 682.) \\n Franco and the Spanish government were apparently fairly perplexed, as they thought they had been negotiating in good faith.  They answered by repeating previous requests for economic aid.  Finally, the German government decided to cut bait--units that would've taken Gibraltar were now needed for Operation Barbarossa--and instructed Stohrer to take no further steps to bring Spain into the war. \\n Around the same time (mid-late 1941), the UK and US really started putting economic pressure on Spain to keep them neutral, which also had an effect.  The UK also spent a shitload in bribes to Franco's generals to get them to advise him to stay out of the war (which was, conveniently, an opinion many of them already shared).  Franco did send the [Blue Division]( to fight on the Eastern Front, but that's basically where the possibility of Spanish intervention in WWII ended. \\n TL;DR : Economic damage during the civil war + incompetence/inexperience among top level German (and Spanish) diplomats + Allied economic pressure = neutral Spain in WWII. \\n Sources:  Documents on German Foreign Policy: 1918-1945 , particularly series C and D;  Spain during World War II  by Wayne H.

Roman doctrine was that the general always fought with his men (to an extent), and was expected to be their equal in combat. A very interesting note on Roman society before I start to digress on this topic is when you look at the dictators. Romans chose a dictator in the event that Rome was in terrible danger and needed one man to lead instead of the two consuls. Dictators had extraordinary powers and served 6 month terms (in the Republic), and they were expected to put that back down when the trouble ended - best example of this is  Cinncinnatus \\n Generally, though, Roman commanders wouldn\\'t fight in the front line, as is commonly portrayed. They had command posts and used those command posts to their maximum effect. However, they were strict practitioners of the saying \"When the going gets tough, the tough gets going,\" and one of the more famous examples of this is a badass that you\\'ve never heard of named Publius Decius Mus. [Livy describes the scene rather well]( even if he IS a little bit long winded about the whole thing. I\\'ll quote the relevant parts! \\n > At first both armies fought with equal strength and equal determination. After a time the Roman hastati on the left, unable to withstand the insistency of the Latins, retired behind the principes. During the temporary confusion created by this movement, Decius exclaimed in a loud voice to M. Valerius: ‘Valerius, we need the help of the gods! Let the Pontifex Maximus dictate to me the words in which I am to devote myself for the legions.’ The Pontifex bade him veil his head in his toga praetexta, and rest his hand, covered with the toga, against his chin, then standing upon a spear to say these words: \\n > ‘Janus, Jupiter, Father Mars, Quirinus, Bellona, Lares, ye Novensiles and Indigetes, deities to whom belongs the power over us and over our foes, and ye, too, Divine Manes, I pray to you, I do you reverence, I crave your grace and favour that you will bless the Roman People, the Quirites, with power and victory, and visit the enemies of the Roman People, the Quirites, with fear and dread and death. In like manner as I have uttered this prayer so do I now on behalf of the commonwealth of the Quirites, on behalf of the army, the legions, the auxiliaries of the Roman People, the Quirites, devote the legions and auxiliaries of the enemy, together with myself to the Divine Manes and to Earth.’ \\n And if you read that...it\\'s a bit obvious what he\\'s intending on doing. He saw the battle wasn\\'t going too well for his flank (the  hastati  retreating way earlier than he\\'d planned - he never got to commit the  principes  and they were forced into battle prematurely), so he called on the  Pontifex Maximus  (That\\'s where we get the Pope from) to give him a blessing as he headed to the front lines. Or you could just be honest and say he was sacrificing himself, that works too. \\n > He then girded himself with the Gabinian cincture, and in full armour leaped upon his horse and dashed into the middle of the enemy. To those who watched him in both armies, he appeared something awful and superhuman, as though sent from heaven to expiate and appease all the anger of the gods and to avert destruction from his people and bring it on their enemies. All the dread and terror which he carried with him threw the front ranks of the Latins into confusion which soon spread throughout the entire army. This was most evident, for wherever his horse carried him they were paralysed as though struck by some death-dealing star; but when he fell, overwhelmed with darts, the Latin cohorts, in a state of perfect consternation, fled from the spot and left a large space clear. The Romans, on the other hand, freed from all religious fears, pressed forward as though the signal was then first given and commenced a great battle. Even the rorarii rushed forward between the companies of antepilani and added strength to the hastati and principes, whilst the triarii, kneeling on their right knee, waited for the consul\\'s signal to rise. \\n For reference, the  roarii  were supposed to stay back with the  triarii . But! There\\'s your first example of a general going all Rambo! Rome won that battle, by the way ;) \\n \\n Let\\'s zoom in a few centuries later, to a little-known battlefield in  Hispania , and downhill, their foe - an aged general named Caius Julius Caesar, who had lined up his eight, severely understrength (but veteran) legions at the bottom of the slope. Caesar\\'s famed  Legio X Equestris  held his right flank, while his  Fifth  and  Third  held his left. Caesar commanded his men to advance, despite the disadvantage they would be at marching uphill - he trusted to his luck and the skill of his men to carry the day. \\n Unfortunately for Caesar, he severely underestimated the Pompeians. A good number of them were men that he\\'d pardoned before and who\\'d promptly turned around to fight against him once again! There was NO way they were going to waver - and the fighting was extremely (unexpectedly) bitter. A quick note - most of the men in Pompey\\'s legions were green. Green men didn\\'t tend to fight all that hard before they broke - but these ones fought like cornered wolves, and Caesar\\'s line began to waver, the  Tenth  actually being driven back. According to Plutarch! \\n > Caesar, seeing that his men were being driven from their ground and making a feeble resistance, ran through the arms and the ranks calling out,  \"If they had no sense of shame, to take and deliver him up to the boys.\" \\n He\\'s essentially calling them out for pussying out to these green boys who\\'ve never fought before - these grizzled, hard-bitten veterans who killed a million men in Gaul were being beaten here? BULLSHIT! So Caesar grabbed the shield from one of his legionaries, strode up within 10 paces of the enemy line, and stood alone, dodging projectiles and catching them on his shield. After a (dumbstruck) moment, he was joined by all of the nearest officers, and then finally, the legionaries. The  Tenth , Caesar\\'s favourite legion (who Caear was actively fighting with at that moment) were the first to break through the Pompeian line. Labienus tried to plug the gap with a reserve legion, while Pompey headed to his OWN front line, but Caesar\\'s cavalry was beginning to envelop the Pompeian flanks, and the entire army finally collapsed. Caesar later said \"I fought many times for victory, but at Munda, I fought for my very life.\" \\n Hope those examples help, and if you have any more questions, let me know! \\n EDIT: TL;DR - The commanders generally fought from the back - but if it became necessary, they headed to the front line to hold that line together. \\n',\n  0),\n ('There were probably a good many such kingdoms--although few have both the antiquity of middle/upper Nile entities, while still having significant information known about them.  You\\'re asking specifically about Kush, so I\\'ll limit my suggestions to that, but as we find out more it\\'s kind of humbling what historians and archaeologists don\\'t know because work simply hasn\\'t been done. \\n Kush is a general term that covers a succession of kingdoms.  The term is sometimes used with imprecise equation with \"Nubia,\" so some material falls under that header as well.  \"Kushite Nubia\" tends to be the earlier era past the first cataract; \"Meroitic Nubia\" is later and further south, while \"Medieval Nubia\" is usually the Christian kingdoms that survived the Islamic invasion but eventually converted in the 1200s-1400s. \\n For the earliest period, before c.1500BCE, you\\'re thinking of Kerma (Karmah) and its predecessors.  There\\'s a recent collected volume called  Ancient Nubia: African Kingdoms on the Nile  (2012) that includes newer archaeology from the American University in Cairo, so it\\'s likely to be more technical but also quite recent.  I found it pretty readable, and a lot of university libraries do have it.  Timothy Kendall had a book in 1997 (I think) entitled  Kerma and the Kingdom of Kush , which the US National Museum of African Arts underwrote, and which provided a really nice overview.  Peter Garlake\\'s  Early African Art and Architecture  has great images, but is very dated by comparison.

I obviously misinterpreted your question. \\n Romans were in favour of \"just wars,\" meaning they could not just randomly attack people, but needed a reason. The reason could be defending an ally, or being insulted by some policy or something. It didn\\'t have to be a strong reason, but there had to be one. In the early days, an priest - (a pater patratus)[Source1]( [source2]( - would be sent to the enemy territory and they would say a couple of ritual phrases in front of the border and then to the first guy he meets. He would make a couple of demands and if those demands weren\\'t met in 33 days, Rome would declare war. Later on, it would obviously take to long to go to enemy territory, make the demands and then travel back with the news, so they just named a small area near Roma \\'enemy territory\\', so the ritual would remain and since - obviously - no answer would come, the war would be justified. \\n So the Romans thought it would be very important that these wars would not be imperialist (in name, at least), but justified and with good reason. If there wouldn\\'t be a good reason, the Gods wouldn\\'t give their support and we all know what happens then... (insert dramatic music here) \\n Anyway, since no one really believes in the peaceful motivations of Rome, lets move on to the next answer. Wars can be bloody profitable. (pun intended) When Julius Caesar went to fight the Gauls in present France, he was pretty much broke. There were people who thought he fled the city to avoid paying his debts. (I can\\'t find the source for this, so it might be wrong) He came back a rich man. \\n I\\'m sure you\\'ve heard of  triumphus , including captured nobility and royalty, but also captured slaves, plundered riches etc etc. After a triumphus, a general would turn to the Senate and ask/demand that they would grant land to the veterans of the campaign. Since land was the main source of income for someone, this meant a lot to the veterans. It was also used to send proper Romans to outer regions of the Republic/Empire and help those people assimilate. Again, war was bloody profitable. \\nAt least, it is if there is something to plunder and loot and people to capture to sell as slaves. It sucks if you win but have nothing to show. Or have nothing to pay your soldiers with. It sucks even more if the wars were fought on  your territory , so all you can plunder are your own cities and you don\\'t really want to do that. This was a huge problem in the later periods of the Empire: soldiers wanted riches, but they were necessary for the defence of the Empire and thus couldn\\'t plunder without harming the Roman people there. \\n That was a short (I hope) summary of the why of war. They had to be justified and they had to be profitable. Time and time again, the Roman tried to attack the Persians, because they were really wealthy, but they lost again and again. (So there might have been something like revenge there as well, but still.) The Jews in Jerusalem could be quite troublesome and [revolted several times]( but were subjugated every time. Why? Well, yes, prestige had something to do with it. Also the fact that Jerusalem and Judea were very, very wealthy. The [Arch of Titus]( in Rome was build to commemorate his successes against the Jewish revolt. The guy was granted a Triumphus for his successes and he brought back quite a few Jewish goodies and slaves. \\n Now, I realize I rambled quite a bit there. You asked for people who didn\\'t want to fight in the wars. You might have heard of a guy named Marius? Well, he was a consul and general in the Roman Republic, shortly before Caesar entered the political stage.

This meant that if you didn\\'t want to fight in Rome\\'s wars, you simply didn\\'t join as a soldier. \\n Now, I don\\'t really have an answer to your main question, which is if there were people against the imperialist expansion policy. In the later years of the Empire, it became quite clear that the defences were hard-pressed as they were already and couldn\\'t handle defending yet another province, but that didn\\'t mean that several emperors didn\\'t dream of conquering new territory. Some did, some tried and some were smart enough not to. The setbacks in the Empire were sometimes seen as temporary, and the idea of Rome as the Eternal City, capital of an Empire that would never die remained quite prominent. (Yes, Ravenna became Cappital later on). The definitive end of the Western Roman Empire is often dated to  the Sack of Rome : \"The sack of the city sent a thrill of horror round the Roman world, which has been echoed ever since: ‘In one city,’ St Jerome wrote, ‘the whole world perished.’ \" \\n TL;DR/Summary: I don\\'t know of any real movements against expansionist ideologies. War was profitable for a long time and though I\\'m sure people objected to certain specific campaigns, the idea of Roma as the eternal city of an eternal empire remained in place until the Sack of Rome by the Visigoths. So I don\\'t think they really had something against the imperialist ideologies, though practical thinking sometimes forced them to defend rather than attack and conquer. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"While this is an interesting question, this is for the most part not a question you should be asking a historian.

Also, there is this book (which I am going to check out of the library in about 10 minutes):  A body incorporate; the evolution of city-county separation in Virginia  by Chester Bain (UVA Press, 1967). \\n The important bits: \\n \"This separation of counties and independent cities evolved slowly beginning with the incorporation of the first city, Williamsburg, in 1722...Virginia\\'s towns exercise some functions of self-government but in many respects are political subdivisions of the counties in which they are located. The General Assembly first passed an act in 1680 to establish towns for commercial centers in Virginia. When few towns resulted under the act, the assembly tried again in 1691 and in 1705 with the same result. Much of the colony was too sparsely populated and insufficiently productive to generate many thriving towns. Each time the assembly repealed the recent town act and after 1710 gave up the attempt to establish towns en masse altogether. The first state constitutional mention of separate cities and counties came in the Constitution of 1869 and in the enabling legislation passed in the 1869–1870 General Assembly session.\" \\n According to this, it looks like the 1870 Constitution was trying to use an long-standing strategy of economic development. I think this makes sense considering the sorry state of the post-War, post-slavery, post-WV-secession economy. \\n edit : Here\\'s some material from the Bain book, plus a little of my own interpretation. \\n \"The absence of obvious constitutional or statutory authority for the independent city has given rise to considerable speculation as to the origins and bases of the practice in Virginia. A popular explanation that has been advanced from time to time is that the Virginia colonists merely adopted a well-known practice followed in England...There are certain factors which indicate that it is not a completely satisfactory explanation\" (28). \\n Bain cites the fact that city-county separation was not clearly defined in the seventeenth and eighteenth century, plus West Virginia (plus other \"English states\") do not follow this practice, thus suggesting the \"Virginia practice emerged much later than the incorporation of Williams and Norfolk\" (29). Williamsburg\\'s original charter never explicitly cited independence, although there\\'s supporting evidence that it was both independent as well as part of James City and York counties. Generally though, the idea of city-county separation was not a clearly established principle in the case of Williamsburg (32). Regarding West Virginia, there were a number of places granted city status (Wheeling, Morgantown). Bain argues that if separation had been followed consistently statewide, then these cities\\' status would have been independent of their counties unless the West Virginia government had deliberately changed their status. This never happened, so the WV cities were never separated from their counties. Finally, there is no evidence that \"any other state ever made a city independent when it was first incorporated\" (34). \\n Bain ultimately argued that city independence \"evolved gradually and developed through the years until it gained general acceptance\" (37). He placed its formal acceptance with the 1869 Constitution. \"The only legal authority explicitly stating that cities shall be independent of counties is a short phrase buried in a statute establishing county townships originally enacted in 1870 and continued in effect today\" (37). Legal documents seem to implicitly understand the separation as opposed to explicitly stating it. \\n edit 2 : Bain believed colonial motivations were to \"encourage the development of municipalities\" (37), aka they wanted to get towns to grow more. However, the pre-Civil War Constitutions were not explicit. The only separation came with taxes and representation, but according to Bain, this wasn\\'t enough of an explicit dividing. In fact, the 1851 and 1869 Constitutions were effectively the same regarding the two house legislature, circuit court structure, and mode of electing court officials... but the 1869 version now \"required, for the first time, that each county be subdivided into three or more townships...\" (39-40). Further, each township could not include a \"part of any town or city having a separate organization or a population of 5000 or more inhabitants...This provisions contitutes the only explicit, general basis for city-county separation that has been found\" (40). There are a few other references that Bain found. He also noted that local Virginia governments were quick to seize upon the official distinction. Since 1870, other Constitutional updates have removed the explicit distinction, but again assume city-county separation throughout in matters such as representation, schools, and courts. \\n tl;dr -->  Some people think it was something inherited from the English, but it wasn\\'t. It appears to have informally developed out of the unique Virginian experience stretching back to the early Colonial period, but historians are unsure of its origins. Bain argued it was more or less taken for granted throughout all of Virginia political history until it was first explicitly stated in the 1869 Constitution. Bain can\\'t pinpoint the idea\\'s origins, but he seems to think it emerged out of a desire in the Virginia colony to develop larger urban centers for trade. \\n edit 3  Thanks for Reddit Gold someone! \\n edit 4  For any graduate students out there, I think this would merit a pretty good thesis topic.

There are several challenges with the independent cities structure, in particular independent cities often have lower tax bases, they often develop forms of revenue sharing with local counties where counties give cities part of their income (primarily to support their schools).\\nHowever, there are benefits to the system. The political and social needs of urban communities are often much different than those of the surrounding county. Charlottesville, for example, with its high student and low income family population has much higher public transportation and social needs than the primarily rural Albemarle county. Also, Charlottesville focuses on developing more livable urban space (the open air downtown mall for example), this sort of political interest is not present in Albemalre county. And therein lays the benefit of the independent system. More often than not, the population of the surrounding county is much higher than that of the independent city, Fredericksburg only has one fifth of Spotsylvania's population. If they were one political entity, the interest of urban Fredericksburg could easily be overlooked in favor of the interests of suburban and rural Spotsylvania. As a Fredericksburg native, I can say that the interests and needs vary significantly between the two political entities, particularly issues of historic preservation, commercial development, welfare needs, and public transportation. \\n TL;DR: Independent city organization isn't super efficient, but it allows for greater political representation in urban vs. suburban areas. \\n edit: N.B. Despite the apparent issues with independent cities, the Commonwealth of Virginia is continuously ranked as one of the best run states in the country.

By doing away with attempts to understand the reasoning and the ideology behind Nazism and the atrocities that have been committed in the name of it, the questions of guilt, blame and responsibility become meaningless. In dismissing the words and actions of the top officials as apart from rationality, we give up our ability to use rationality to examine and criticize nazism. In giving up this tool of rationality we de-humanize the guilty, in making them puppets of their own madness or the madness of others. Essentially this is why i called it the easy way out. Rather than accepting that the incomprehensible amount of suffering and death Nazism has caused was the work of humans, real people with feelings, rationality and reasoning, your statement transforms the perpetrators of crimes into faceless, inscutable mad men. Taking that a step further would make the Second World War a non-event, a regrettable accident, which is in my opinion not an acceptable way of looking at it. Precisely because the guilty were human and used human rationality, however inconsistent and twisted, to justify their actions, their motives and rationales have to be analysed. \\n This consequentialist argument is, of course, no proof that top Nazis were not operating so far away from reason, that you can not analyze them. \\n So i would ask you to look at the actual actions undertaken by Nazi government. They were in the vast majority of cases mundane and everyday administrative actions. Nazi government and administration worked to a certain degree, which leads me to the conclusion that, if the top officials were simply mad men, they would have to have been highly functional mad men. \\n Of course many unusual, inhumane and atrocious actions were also undertaken. But examined under the spotlight of the Nazi Ideology they make a certain degree of sense. The fact that you or i do not share that ideology should not stop us from realising that. In the mindset of someone thinking in terms of a certain kind of racism, historical teleology or operating within a system that requires him to publicly adhere to such beliefs, a lot of the seemingly nonsensical or \"crazy\" actions can in fact be analyzed. \\n The discussion has touched on the inconsistent and divergent nature of Nazi policy and ideology. The very fact that Nazism was often inconsistent with itself and people who are rightly considered Nazis held different opinions, is an indicator that Nazism can not in fact be dismissed as the \"creation of a mad man\", as DanDierdorf put it.

There were some mosaic depictions of Belisarius at the Chalke Gate of the Imperial Palace at Constantinople that Prokopius speaks about, but they haven't survived so we can't compare. We simply can't prove that Belisarius is portrayed at Ravenna. I have never heard anyone claim that the bearded official was originaly identified with another inscription like Maximian. I'd say that it is very unlikely that this was the case as there is no evidence for it that I know of. I'd even go so far and propose that this might not even be the portrait of an actual person but just another generic member of the court. Depicting a younger and an older man could easily have been a way to show the range of different people that the imperial court was composed of without refering to anyone in particular. This might be even more likely when you consider that the portrait of the man between Justinian and Maximian was most likely not part of the original mosaic. \\n For the next part I'm going to refer to a study conducted by Irina Andreescu-Treadgold and Warren Treadgold which was published in the following article by the those two authors:  Procopius and the Imperial panels of S. Vitale, in: The Art Bulletin 79, No. 4 (Dec. 1997), 708-23.  An important result from this study is the realization that the famous presbytery mosaics of San Vitale were produced in two distinct phases. Phase one comprises the mosaics near and inside the apse including those two showing the imperial couple as well as part of the mosaics in the space surronding the altar. But most of the decoration in this space was actually done in the second phase. Those two phases are distinguishable by the use of different materials for the same colours, for example glass and marble for the colour white. The interesting thing for us is that the mosaic panel showing the emperor was altered in this second phase. Changes were made to the face of the bishop and the inscription showing his name as well as the portrait of the man right next to him were added. This indeed does explain the awkward placing of this latter figure. Not only does he disrupt the apparent symmetrical composition of the pice with all the clergy on one side of the emperor and the worldly elites on the other, but he also totally lacks a body. It would be hard to explain why an important figure of the court would have not been shown in full while some random clergy member or soldier was. If you look at the bottom of the mosaic you'll notice that he even lacks his feet. This person was most likely later added to the composition. Equally interesting is the case of the bishop. The fact that his face was altered and a inscription with his name added tells us that Maximian most likely wasn't the man that originaly comissioned the mosaic but only inserted himself afterwards. So who was depicted before that? The body wasn't altered so it had to be another bishop, one of Maximian's predecessors. If we consider the fact that Ravenna was until 540 the capital of the Ostrogothic kingdom that was at war with Constantinople, a mosaic depicting the emperor probably wouldn't have been put up until after the capture of the city by Belisarius. That only leaves us with Victor, who was bishop of Ravenna from 538 to 545 when Maximian became his succesor. That means that Maximian's immodest act of replacing his predecessor's face with his own and making sure everyone knew it was him by adding his name allows us to date the two phases of the mosaic with relativ precision. The first one was done under Victor between 540 and 545 and the second one under Maximian between 545 and 556. \\n So before 545 the mosaic showed Victor, who had comissioned the mosaic, and Justinian, who Victor would be eager to please immediately after the regime change at Ravenna. There wouldn't have been any real need to add another portrait of a real person, although a depiction of Belisarius, who after all was the one that captured the city, is entirely possible if unprovable. \\n The man between Justinian and the bishop is a different case. It would make no sense to add another figure, especially in such a prominent place, if this wasn't the portrait of some influencial person. As Maximian seems to have been the one responsible for the changes, a connection  between the two men has to be assumed. Irina Andreescu-Treadgold and Warren Treadgold propose John, the nephew of the former usurper Vitalian, who was related to Justinian's family by marriage and active as a military official in Italy at the time. While possible this also is nothing more than speculation. Other possibilities could include Iulianus Argentarius, a rich banker from the east who provided funds for the construction of several churches in Ravenna including San Vitale or the eunuch Narses, who was supreme commander in Italy from 551 onwards. So while we are certain that this is the portrait of a real person, his identity still eludes us and it's quite possible that this will never change. \\n TL;DR : We are sure that the panel shows emperor Justinian and bishop Maximian, who replaced his predecessor Victor in it. The only other figure that certainly depicts another real person is the man between those two, although we don't really know who it is. Belisarius might be shown, possibly as the bearded official on the left, but we're even less certain about that. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('Similar issues have been brought up before. [The most recent META thread had quite a few responses from users and mods which address the idea of allowing explicitly speculative posts to stand.]( I\\'m copying my response that I gave there to here, as to why allowing speculation posts to remain wouldn\\'t work well given how this subreddit is structured. \\n > >Some subset of comments that are currently being deleted will instead be marked by either \"cogent speculation\" or \"personal anecdote\"\\n> \\n> This actually would require  more  of a judgment call on the part of the mod team than the current system. Having a binary \"pass/fail\" system, while it will have its faults and failures, is going to be far less confusing than having a middle grey area. On top of this, it is almost certain that a fair number of posts which are marked as such, instead of contributing to the discussion of the topic, will simply result in META discussion about whether marking the comment as such was justified. \\n> \\n> This is best represented by our approach to the anecdotes rule currently. Some of the most painful deletions to make are often personal anecdotes - I still complain about one I had to remove where I guy wrote about growing up in Northern Ireland during the troubles (If you are reading this man, I\\'M SORRY!). There is absolutely zero chance we would allow  all  anecdotes and speculation  to stand with some sort of tag, and while it would be possible for us to evaluate each anecdote (or speculation) post on its own merits, this creates a myriad of problems.\\n> \\n>   It turns what is a simple \"Yes/No\" call into a judgement call \"Does this anecdote meet whatever level we have decided they need to meet?\"\\n> \\n>   The fact that it is  possible  an anecdote might stand will cause more people to post, as they think that theirs is worthy of inclusion, turning this into /r/AskReddit, and simply causing more deletions by the increase in overall volume of people posting them.\\n> \\n>   And on that note, the ones that are removed, when the poster disagrees with the removal, will lead to arguments about why a given anecdote deserved to stand.\\n> \\n> So from a practical standpoint, as you can see, there are a few reasons why we don\\'t want to start bending on the rules about anecdotes or speculation (the latter pretty much has the same pitfalls as anecdotes, from a practical standpoint).

These markings wouldn\\'t be visible to them.\\n> \\n> So the TL;DR is that it is a messy system to run, and a nearly impossible one to implement. \\n So that is the sum of it. Allowing speculation to stand would still require only allowing  high quality  speculation to stand, which is something that is much harder to moderate than simply saying \"don\\'t\", and giving a possible opening for those types of responses would really just open the floodgates to them, and quite possibly result in even more deletions! \\n',\n  0),\n ('To point A, I presume you are referring to the following section of text from page 254^1: \\n >While the out-of-Africa population soared from just hundreds (around\\n100,000 years ago) to 200 million (by 0 A.D.), and rose to just over 300\\nmillion in the next 1500 years, the African population increased from\\n1 million to no more than 20 million 100,000 years later (by 0 A.D.), and\\nto only 47 million in A.D. 1500. . . .

(I also sometimes start a point without finishing it, if so call me out on that since I\\'m just procrastinating from writing what I actually should be now). \\n You\\'ll see the popularity wax and wane, often with new professional leagues being developed, expanded, contracted, and dissolved. AFL merges with NFL; NFL adopts some of the rules of AFL play. Professional race-walking leagues were popular city entertainment in the 1890s. Canadian Football is created with a larger field and end-zone because the Canadians are too nice to block and hit each other (I kid, I kid, I know it has more in common with the rugby legacy there). \\n It won\\'t take societal collapse or even the disappearance of a sport for us to stop asking if Player X is better than Jordan. As sports evolve,  comparisons are generally made to those athletes who would be best known to a contemporary audience. Sports nuts LOVE quantitative stats, but you can never account for the intangibles that are necessary to compare, say Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1969-1989) to George Mikan (1946-1956). The fact that one Mr. Wilt Chamberlain (1959-1973) played right in-between them and completely changed the rules of the game makes it almost impossible to compare. But that\\'s exactly the nature of the sport. There are so many changes over time; you may only see one or two seemingly-minute NFL league rules changed per year, but when you look at a decade as a whole? Twenty years? Fifty? It may not be a completely different sport, but the type of athlete that excels in that current environment is unique. Jim Thorpe was a hell of an athlete. A goddamn pure athletic specimen, as noted by the (perhaps apocryphal) story of King Gustav of Sweden calling him \"the greatest athlete in the world\" at the 1912 Olympics. He almost always ends up ranked high in lists of the 20th Century\\'s Greatest Athletes. But you wouldn\\'t hear people say that \"Jerry Rice is the next Jim Thorpe.\" They played in such different environments that it\\'s hard to contextualize how they would each fare in the other\\'s time, playing with each other\\'s rules. \\n Anyway, the point I\\'m trying to demonstrate with this is that 1. our view on current leagues/sports is such a narrow scope in the historical picture and 2. most sports now find ways to evolve with the times, lest they become extinct. From my own work on horse-racing, you see regional shifts and popularity spikes, but the sport doesn\\'t collapse. If your question is \"how have other sports come to an end?\" and not \"what are some examples of extinct sports?\", then perhaps we could look at horse-racing as an example of how a sport  almost  came to an end but still hung on (at least in the United States, though I know there was a similar situation in Britain). Reformers of all stripes, religious, moral, city, etc., came together during the Progressive Era and one of their aims was the destruction of the \"menace of legalized gambling\". Despite backlash and a good fight from the racetrack owners and horsemen, by around 1906, many US states began the process of banning track gambling, and effectively, horse racing in general. After all, the purses and tracks themselves were in part subsidized by gambling money. Without it, the purse size shrinks, horsemen are less willing to travel far for races, and many actually send their horses over to Europe to the British, French, and Russian tracks. That the major horse owners sent their horses to Europe even BEFORE the total abolition of gambling is telling of both just how poor the potential earnings were in the remaining states and how competitive and lucrative the European track was at that time. (Of course the European track scene would be left devastated by World War I as most of the prime thoroughbred race horses transitioned to cavalry mounts.) By 1911, there were only I think three states that allowed race track gambling (Florida, Maryland(?) and I can\\'t remember the last). Most of the major tracks in the cities either converted to provide some other source of entertainment, like early car racing or plane races, or they just shut down, like most of the major New York ones after Governor Hughes signed the Hart-Agnew law. Names like Gravesend, Brighton Beach, Sheepshead Bay, and Jerome Park would still have some importance, but it was no longer for the major race tracks they hosted. (Gravesend actually ran the Preakness Stakes for a few years instead of Pimlico.) Horse racing in the major United States cities was effectively dead from about 1909-1918. \\n So now the question is how did it return? As Mark Twain was once misquoted, \"the reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.\" The sport itself remained generally the same, but the nature of gambling was what changed in the intervening years. Going from a traditional system of bookmakers to one of parimutuel betting, with attempts at oral betting in-between, professional gamblers and race track owners tried multiple innovative methods to skirt the laws. If the law said that they could not make betting books, then they would simply use a piece of paper and an oral bet. If they couldn\\'t make oral bets, they used parimutuel machines. (Though in some states, there were specific laws mentioning machines, but they were meant for roulette \"machines\" and applied to parimutuel through vague wording.) Parimutuel betting had been around in the United States since Matt Winn introduced it at Churchill Downs in the 1880s, but it did not really take off until about the time that many states began to allow gambling again, and thus racing. Many of these attempts did end up with the heads of the track meets being arrested, but the cases were tied up in the legal system for years, often making their way to the state Supreme Courts. During these years you also saw the sport move further south to Mexico with major tracks in Mexicali, Tijuana, and Juarez, though that was only the tip of the vice-berg there. In the end though, there were far too many factors as to why the sport nudged its way back to legality for me to mention, often very state-specific, with few I know in that much detail. But a good summation would be that the public demand for racing was still present and once the state laws allowed for it, some but not all of the tracks reopened ready to supply that demand. \\n Anyway, I hope you could follow my constantly derailing train of thought, but the TL;DR is:  Most modern sports don\\'t die as much as evolve. The specifics of the game are different enough that we can\\'t make genuine statistical comparisons between players of different eras, but the fundamentals generally remain constant. \\n I recently read some article that I wish I could remember more of. Someone found some Civil War-era source that described a sport that modern scholars couldn\\'t identify. It had similar characteristics to some modern sports (if I remembered which, I could probably find the article), but it was different enough that they classified it as a dead sport. That\\'s probably the closest to modern of the unidentified dead sports you are looking for. Can anyone help me with a source for that? As always, for the rest, I could cite sources upon request. \\n',\n  0),\n ('You ask a question with a lot of different answers, many of them minefields of orientalism, cultural imperialism and bigotry.  However, since I am actually in Turkey at the moment and also just finished watching the same match, I\\'ll attempt to explain the basics. \\n First and foremost, I don\\'t think we live in a time currently where women are so overtly concerned with being \"western\" as they used to.  Additionally, we live in a time where non-Western governments (Turkey included) are less concerned with how \"western\" their women appear.  Also, this discussion of \"western\" has, and still is, conflated (a bit wrongly) with a discourse of \"Modernity\" which we should look out for.  However, there was a time when such processes were self-consciously and vigorously employed by non-Western governments, notably Turkey and Iran (and in Iran we have witnessed both forced uncovering and forced covering in the space of less than half a century). \\n One other interesting point hidden behind your question is that you directly correlate \"western\" and the status of certain women\\'s appearances.  This is a problematic (and to some people offensive) distinction you have made, BUT I find it hard to fault you for it because of the history behind it.  In every nationalism-building process the leaders of the movement are eventually faced with the same question \"what do we do with our women?\"  Without giving you a full doctoral thesis on the history of gender and power, I\\'ll just say that this question has always resulted in the cultural predilections of particular political movements being projected onto the powerless women of their society.   And in some cases, Turkey included, this projection was done in the name of feminine empowerment -- but that empowerment always had its limits and it in terms of legal reforms, there were never any female agents.  Female empowerment, in Turkey especially, was not exactly the product of a decades long fight for suffrage, rather a \"blessing\" bestowed upon the populace by an autocratic male ruler. \\n Nonetheless, these reforms (see the link by schept below) did come to fruition, and even before many \"western\" nations.  Turkey has slowly become a more open society over the last 90 years, and this is thanks both to piecemeal legal reforms, open cultural channels to the rest of the world, and a hardworking, indigenous feminist movement.  The recent developments politically, which have seen the rise of a party that is religiously oriented, economically neoliberal and has been somewhat successful at tearing down some of the more autocratic structures of the governmental system as led to an even more open society that in fact borrows just has much from the \"west\" as it does the \"east\".  This should be taken into consideration with your question.  In the end, if there were women on the volleyball team with hijabs, that wouldn\\'t make Turkey less open, less \"western\" or more \"eastern\" or backwards or what have you.  It is a country where women can (mostly) do what they want and to me, that is a universal good, not just a western privilege. \\n tl:dr -- Turkey is relatively free, open and democratic, but not necessarily thanks to being \"western\". \\n',\n  0),\n ('>And in some cases, Turkey included, this projection was done in the name of feminine empowerment -- but that empowerment always had its limits and it in terms of legal reforms, there were never any female agents.

A woman who chooses to wear the hijab can be (and should ideally be) just as free, educated, and participatory in the systems of her country as one who does not. A woman being forced not to wear something is just as harmful as a woman being forced to wear something.

In Ancient Athens and Sparta, there were no serious debates. Athens was unique amongst the ancient world in that it was a direct democracy, but this is often too Romanticized. Athens was completely dysfunctional. Notable examples of its failure were the execution of generals who failed to pick up allied crews after a naval battle, the gruesome and wrongful execution of treasurers of the Delian League until they were later exonerated by finding out the \"fraud\" was really an accounting error (the people in charge of that were also executed), and the forced suicide of Socrates \"because he was unpopular.\" Basically imagine if the same mentality of High School elections was used in foreign, economic, and social policy. Absolute chaos. Because of this, Plato advocated a dictatorship ruled by an elite of philosophers. \\n There were always serious debates in any democracy, functional or not, and unless somebody could prove several counter-examples for this point I would tend to think it false. I have read several ancient accounts which talk about the \"silver tongued\" Athenian politicians. Further his examples of \"dysfunctional government\" all come from the Peloponnesian war, further a point in that war in which the Athenian forces were being defeated at every turn. One could argue that these examples were merely the elected government, or the people, taking vengeance on the generals for losing battles. However, this isnt to say the Athenian government was the model of direct diplomacy, it wasnt. It was an oligarchy which represented the landed interest almost entirely. There was little room for the mob to take the reigns of their own government. But for the time, it was the best form democracy could take. Despite our problems, the same can be said of the US, especially in the early years. \\n >Most cities either were ruled by a king, or by a city council/senate made up of land owners and two consular \"kings,\" along with plebiscites available for certain decisions. \\n This is sort of true, but wrong in who it talks about (unless its a terrible segway(sp), in which boo on him). In most Greek and Italian City/states a monarch/dictator ruled absolutely. Examples like Archons, Tyrants, and actual kings. But many cities also had councils with more or less power, which advised the ruler, dealt with minor issues, or even ruled completely. In Rome, and later the city states it took into its protection, it was ruled since the 530s BC by two Consuls with Kingly powers (each Consul had the total power of a king, but the Consuls had to share that power in some way). But the Roman Senate was also very powerful and  wielded much power compared to the \"kingly\" Consuls. Plus Plebeians were elected as Tribunes who had the power to veto almost all business, from legislation, to elections, to the levy of troops. \\n >By contrast, the Roman Republic was very similar (eerily similar, in my opinion) to the current American Republic. A strong legislature dominated by special interest groups with senators in clearly defined roles. Once equality was reached between the Plebeians and Patricians after the Conflict of the Orders, Rome was the closest humanity has gotten to a true democracy until the American Republic. \\n This is very opinionated. You can draw strong comparisons to the US form of government, after all ours was based off of theirs. To judge this argument, it would really depend on when and who he was talking about. Some leaders and periods were quite democratic, but others, especially during the Roman Revolution (duh), were turbulent and patently anti-democratic. But what I will say is that I dont agree with the bit about special interests. In the US, we have lobby groups who advocate for different views or industries. Corn lobby wants better corn and farming laws. NRA wants more lenient gun laws, ect. The Roman state (after the conflict between Patrician and Pleb) was far simpler, IMO. It was more those looking for personal gain, glory and fame, or people advocating for the old order. That, to me, is a whole different beast. \\n >The problem with the Roman Republic (and this builds off of the eeriness of its similarity to America) is that its Senators fell into two factions: the Popularis and the Optimates. In the Second Century BCE, repeated wars of conquest had drained the Italian countryside of their workers to fight in the armies. Normally, under the levy system, Roman citizens would be drafted in March (named after the Roman God of War, Mars), after planting their crops, and fight until harvest (or longer). In the meantime, their estates were managed by the women and their slaves. Extended campaigns seriously interfered with this model, and most farms could not make ends meet. At the same time, power was accumulating with the wealthier echelons of the Republic. These farmlands were muscled out by wealthy land owners who could use their legions of slaves as cheap labor to outproduce the smaller farms. When they went bankrupt, they simply bought out the property and consolidated it into large plantations known as Latifundia. At one point, just six men owned all of the agricultural lands in Africa. \\n This is mostly true and accurate, except for the middle part about the levy. The way Ive always learned it, it was a little more nuanced. The wealthy Senators generally took as much land as they could for themselves. This destroyed the middle class of the Romans, who made up the bulk of the army. See, army requirements were based on wealth. The more weapons you could afford to buy yourself, the higher your status in society was. BUT as these heavy infantry men became destitute, the body and soul of Rome, its powerful legion, faded. Importantly, continued success on the field of battle made the senators feel that the Legion was still invincible. The powerful Gracchi brothers then came into the situation, and basically advocated for much needed agrarian reform (among other things). They introduced Popularii politics, or politics which focused on pleasing the people, and by people I mean the Capite Censii (literally the head count, the landless mob) not the whole state(see the Senators). This, and the general Popularii method which the Gracchi practiced annoyed the Senators, who killed both men. This introduced mob rule and Violence into Roman politics. \\n >Returning veterans came home to find their farms in complete ruin, bankrupted, and their life savings gone because their wives and daughters could not keep up with demand. This caused a massive amount of displaced farmers to move into the city of Rome, causing its districts to swell. The problem with this was that these citizens had no jobs and no means of entertainment. They were also democratically enfranchised. \\n This is basically true, especially of the displaced Farmers. This was the agitated element of the Capite Censii who were so susceptible to the Gracchi\\'s agitation.  Also, the agrarian reform targeted not the land of veterans, but even worse, the land of men who died during war. This was supposed to go to the state for resale, but instead it was just kept by the state while wealthy Senators farmed the land instead. But basically, the base requirement of the Roman voting right was money/assets. This was derived from land mostly. \\n >Because of this added electoral pressure, the Senate decided on enacting initially short term measures of a proto-Welfare system. Free grain would be distributed to the unemployed at no charge. The problem with this was that politicians saw this as being too effective. From 128 BCE to the end of the Republic, this was exploited by Senators wishing to be elected to higher office. More grain, and later, more gladiatorial games, were to be paid for at the states\\' expense, which later proved to create a crippling debt. Further, this required Rome to seek out cheaper sources of Grain, as well as to ensure the burgeoning middle class (some of the more successful displaced farmers) had jobs, thus wars were waged in the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East to secure cheap grain and trade contracts. This is termed Panem et Circenses. \\n The grain dole was an important method to control the Capite Censii. This was necessary to  maintain the huge population of Rome. Without it, those who couldnt afford grain would starve and be pushed into even more radical hands. But it was a self feeding cycle, if you wanted to put a lid on popular agitation, or you wanted to cause more agitation, a Roman politician, of any party, would try and push forth cheaper grain till eventually it was free. Also, anybody who was causing too many problems, would be put in charge of the dole. It was inevitable that a plague or locusts would come along and destroy the important crops, and make your job impossible. And no body, once dependent on the dole would ever appreciate a missed shipment. Marc Antony did this to Augustus to try and side line him, but Augustus managed to sort it out well, while Antony cavorted with an Egyptian woman and promised her kids half of the Empire. However, the end of this is really not true. Egypt and Sicily were the two most important grain baskets in Europe at the time. Rome had won Sicily from Carthage after the First Punic war. Egypt was controlled by pro-Roman Ptolemaic rulers from the time of Scipio until  the Civil war between Cleopatra and her Ptolemaic brother. BUT the reason why Julius Caesar famously intervened in the war was because of the murder of his rival Pompey the Great. In retribution, Caesar sided with Cleopatra and forced her to take his side in Roman politics. Later, Marc Antony came and became close with her. She even took his side during Antony\\'s war with Caesar Augustus. After Antony\\'s death, and the suicide of Cleopatra, Augustus found himself in sole control of Egypt. Lucky him. \\n >Several reforms were undertaken (notably by Marius, to shift the army from a levy force to a predominantly professional one, thus creating one of the first military-industrial complexes), but to little effect. These politicians were known as the Popularis, or those voting for the people. Their opponents, notably the aristocracy, termed the Optimates, resented the serious cost and exploitation of the welfare system, and, rather than attack the wealthy landowners who monopolized everything, tried to undermine the plebeian class while mourning the demise of traditional Roman morality. (This was mostly Cato, who loathed the fact that traditional marriage within social spheres was being disrupted--i.e. Patricians were marrying slaves and bequeathing their vast estates to non-citizens, whom they took as wives and sons--and that traditional Roman women were being sidelined in favor of slaves. Cato also loathed that Greek and Persian customs, such as theater and idealistic art, and religious practices, such as orgies and Mystery religions, and he wanted to restore Rome to its former glory of strong civic duty, proper honor and obedience of the Roman Pantheon, and spartan-esque austerity). \\n Ive already touched on several economic reforms (Grain dole and Agrarian reform) but the reforms of Marius are very important, and very successful. Basically, Marius saw the decay of the Army (especially against resurgent gauls in Northern Italy) and decided that the old system of property based levying was inefficient. He therefore removed all monetary requirements for the soldiers, and instead paid them with land and money from the state, along with land and booty from conquered territory. Further, he introduced state funded arming and clothing of all legionaries (along with more structural changes to the legions which arnt really related to this topic). Gaius Marius created a truly professional force whose only job was to serve \"the state\" and was hired from those landless mobs of Rome. Problem was the state couldnt pay the soldiers regularly and the rich were categorically unwilling to give land to the poor veterans. But the poor couldnt quit, what else could they do? Go back to living in a gutter? So they were stuck, and pissed at the state. So when charismatic Generals gave their soldiers foreign booty they became happy, and loyal. Then when it came for the legions to march on Rome, or against the legions of another political player, who was the soldiers go with, the State who barely paid them and would probably go back on land promises or the General who had already gave them booty and land in Gaul? This was the unintentional outcome of the Marian reforms. It would empower the Army under Julius and Augustus Caesar and its power would only increase until the army would eventually destroy the empire in the 3rd, 4th and 5th centuries AD. \\n >The famous Popularis of all time was Gaius Julius Caesar, who used his rhetoric, wealth acquired for his Gallic campaigns, and political nepotism to engineer his rise to power. He eventually defeated Pompey, who was the Optimates, but later was assassinated. After the ensuing chaos, it would be Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus (known as Octavian) who finally restores balance to the Republic by turning it into a de facto dictatorship under the Principate. \\n This is basically true, for the reasons above. The only thing I would argue was that Julius was was not a Popularii persay, but more an opportunist. He initially sided with conservatives like Pompey and Crassus but later after the Triumvirate fell apart and Caesar was to be held accountable for his numerous crimes (MASSIVE FUCKING BRIBERY and the manhandling of his Co-Consul) he fled to his province, and became I guess a Popularii. But he was more of an army guy, as they were the base of all of his power. That was the secret of the Julio-Claudian empire. It was all in the Army. \\n Ouch. That hurt.

Not too bad for a \"dysfunctional\" state. \\n Third, the Roman Republic was very different to the US Republic. Rome had a strong class system in the form of the Patricians, Equites and Plebs. \\n This is quite different to the US where one can become a millionaire or be elected to political office no matter your background. \\n Additionally, Rome maintained a hegemonic order within Italy were it\\'s allies had to supply military troops on demand.

Stalin realised this and true to his nature toyed with Churchill (whom he always never liked). Roosevelt focused all his energies and attention (waning thought they might have been) on Stalin – they even had 3 private conferences, while he denied Churchill’s request for one private session on the grounds that Stalin might get suspicious. \\n It is in this context on the third and final day, that (what is to me a school boy level of tomfoolery and attempts to curry favour  - this is purely my speculation based on the multiple sources I have read on the Yalta conference) Roosevelt in a stage whisper to Stalin said that “Winston is in a cranky mood as he woke up on the wrong side of the bed”, he then proceeded to mock peculiar British traits – all the while Stalin is slowly building up into a happy mood which then erupts in a nice long loud laugh. \\n Churchill very justifiably got offended, and both Stalin and Roosevelt had to mollify him. \\n Tl;dr : The entire Yalta conference was seen as a mockery of British aims by Churchill, this was topped of on the final day by Roosevelt mocking his direct person.

If cavalry or troops with specialised close-combat weapons can get close to you, your musket, even with a bayonet, becomes less helpful. \\n What does this have to do with volley fire? Suppose all of your men fire at once. Great! You've inflicted some damage. But what now? All of your men are now reloading. For much of the time a volley-fire strategy was being used, a person could travel the effective range of a firearm in the time it takes to reload that firearm.  Thus, while all your men are reloading, your enemy can get to you without being shot! now you wonder why you've been carrying a gun around this whole time. \\n TL;DR- Volley fire was a way to have some of your men fire now, and others fire later, so there weren't 'gaps' where the enemy could approach without being shot while still reducing the probability of friendly fire. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"Before banks, quite simply you didn't buy a house in another country.

Everyone with a passing knowledge of Roman history is familiar with the mythical foundation of Rome in 753 BC and the use of that date as a point of reference for the counting of years AVC or \\'ab urbe condita\\', from the foundation of the city. So the year 100 would be 653 AVC. This is called an Era, which records time from a fixed point in time on. In this case, though, it is a literary invention, created by M. Terrentius Varro around the beginning of the first century BC who calculated the foundation of Rome for the 440th year after the destruction of Troy (in Roman mythology the origin of the Roman founding father, Aeneas), which he put in 1193 BC). Cato did a similar calculation and ended up with 752 BC. \\n The problem with this is that, while seeming convenient, it was rarely practically used outside literature in daily life. Other Eras, which were used to keep track of time, particularly in the East, were the Seleukid Era, beginning in the year 312/311 BC and numerous local Eras that used locally important starting points. Another example for a well known Era would be the counting of the Olympiads. \\n So what system did the Romans use to date a certain event? If we find Roman inscriptions today, in many cases we are able to date them because they put the two (sometimes only one) eponymous Consuls of a certain year at the end, like so: \\n FAVSTINO ET RVFINO CO(N)S(VLIBVS)\\n \\n meaning \"during the consulship of Faustinus and Rufinus\". This could be followed by an exact date using the Roman calendary system. \\nSince the term of a consul lasted for one year (but only after 153 BC did a consular term begin on 1. January), if you knew the names of the consuls you could find out which year was meant by consulting the consular list, the so called  fasti consulares . These were present in practically all cities, and some of them have thankfully survived which makes them incredibly useful for us. Similar lists were put up to keep track of important dates that recurred every year, like anniversaries, religious events and so on. \\n Since the eponymous, ordinary consuls could be followed by so-called suffect consuls during the same year (for example because of illness or death), sometimes the consules suffecti are used for dating, which makes things a little more complicated for us since we do not have complete lists for them. \\n So, the year 100 B.C. to the Romans would have been: \"The year of the Consulship of C. Marius for the sixth time and L. Valerius Flaccus\". \\n TL; DR: Romans named their years after the consuls that served during a certain year. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"I'd say a large part of this question can be answered by contrasting the cultural, political and philosophical differences of both China and Europe. \\n What you see in China is an overwhelming majority of its people (over 90%) identifying within a single monoculture/ethnic group (Han Chinese). This is not to say over 90% are genetically Han Chinese (speculatively they are believed to be far lower) but that it has been decided by the vast majority that this is the ethnic/cultural grouping they identify themselves as. \\n Although China has been divided periodically what you see in their case is a largely unquestioned belief that they are one nation and one people, this in itself has also been reinforced largely through the tenets of confucianism which especially emphasise the importance of social harmony, hierarchy and knowing one's place within society. \\n These factors largely allowed the isolationist feudal state that was China to exist with the Emperor at it's head in relative stability and survive as an intact nation the so called century of shame (European and Japanese intervention). \\n To perhaps reinforce this point if you look at China today and see where some of the main separatist movements are (e.g. Tibet & Uighur regions), these are people who do not fit in the Han monoculture, Confucianist teachings and the Chinese 'Civilisation' and resent having it imposed upon them. \\n Contrasting China with Europe and what you see is instead a hugely diverse set of nations, cultures, beliefs and ethnic groupings with no single one being identified as dominant or most desirable. Perhaps you could argue that Christianity was a unifying factor but even that has devolved into a point of difference between the various branches of Christian belief. \\n Within many of the modern European nation states we still see great points of difference, calls for greater autonomy and independence movements occurring (e.g. Scottish in UK, Catalan & Basque in Spain, Flemish region in Belgium, Northern regions of Italy etc). \\n You can see this influence manifesting in the political writings of Europe, for example the concept of the independent, sovereign nation state, international diplomacy, liberalism and an intense focus on the rights of the Individual. This is almost the complete antithesis of many of the Confucianist tenets that continue to influence China. \\n It took the brilliance of the Romans to unite most of Europe 2000 years ago and even they couldn't manage the burden of such a diverse and fraught continent forever. I'm hopeful the EU will one day be able to realise the idea of a United States of Europe but I'm sure that it won't be a party that everyone will join, nor do I believe that further devolution of modern European states is beyond the realm of possibility over the next few years/decades. \\n Tl;dr.

After the taking the city, it continued its conquest into Albania, Serbia, Hungary, Egypt, Iraq, Crimea, and tried several time to take Vienna.

And in fact France allied with the Ottomans as both faced the same enemy, the Habsburg dynasty of Spain and Austria. \\n Also for centuries, European nations were busy fighting each other.

Needless to say that the governments of most of these small states weren't happy with this idea, and would often persecute Italian nationalists.  San Marino had a policy of giving political asylum to Italian nationalists, so much so that when Italy was eventually unified, the victorious nationalists allowed San Marino to keep its independence.  They might have been less generous if it had been a larger state, but it was so small and insignificant, both economically and culturally, that they could treat San Marino's continued independence as a symbolic gesture (in a way that, for example, allowing Parma or the Two Sicilies to keep their independence wouldn't have been). \\n Since Italian unification San Marino has kept its independence simply because subsequent Italian governments have had little reason to try to annex it.  Even Mussolini didn't do so, although he did sponsor and abet San Marino's fascists in taking control of the government (although even local fascists kept San Marino neutral during WW2).  Mussolini's refusal to annex San Marino was sometimes questioned, but he did so because its independence was a relic of the era of Italian unification, an era in Italian history that the fascist government generally saw positively and attempted to link itself to (in another symbolic gesture, the grandson of the hero of Italian independence, ran as a fascist candidate in elections in the late 1920s). \\n So, tl:dr - San Marino was independent prior to unification because it was just one of many tiny independent statelets, and after unification because it was seen as a symbol of the unification era. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('This is one of my favorite topics ever to talk about and you\\'re giving me a reason to so I\\'m going to absolutely go off here ;) \\n One of the major \\'turns\\' of the war was the military turning against the royal family and ultimately, in very large numbers, supporting the revolutionaries. I\\'d like to talk about those factors, but first, some context and that begins with the ascension of Louis XV, the predecessor to Louis XVI who would be the king that would be introduced to the end of the guillotine, to see the beginning of the issues with the military. \\n The army began serious degradation under Louis XV. Competent generals would die of old age and would be replaced by sycophantic noblemen whose competence was not in the field but in the court, most notably, Louis XV\\'s mistress\\' Marquise de Pompadour or her successor, madame du Barry. These two women, John Elting would put it,  \"ruled France and its armies utterly with a pout, a smile, a flutter of eyelashes, a twitch of the hips.\"  The decay would become almost immediately noticeable. French generals would become infamous for their brutal looting practices and leaving the field of battles to go sit at home if the weather went bad, leaving their men in the field to continue drills or battle. \\n In 1758 when General Louis de Bourbon-Conde, aka Comte Clermont, took command of the French army. He was also one of these incompetent generals but his summation of the army\\'s condition is useful: \\n >  \"[This] poor army is in a miserable state . . . companies less than twelve men strong; with hospitals which are dirty and [stink]; no medical orderlies, little linen, little broth. In short, we are in an inconceivable mess; no discipline, either among the officers or the men; hardly any officers with their [units].\" ^[1] \\n To no surprise, the Seven years War was a complete and utter disaster for the French. I\\'m running out of adjectives here but try to understand how absolutely smashed they would be, with almost a casual and \"almost contemptuous expertise.\" I can not understate the shame that reverberated through the French military from highest officer to lowest soldiers and this would be the straw that would break the camels back and cause mass reform over the next few years. I\\'m going to go over these reforms briefly as they help put more context to the utter fuckup that was Louis XVI. \\n First was Etienne Francois de Choiseul, his tenure was 1764-1771 for reference. His most notable achievement was to convert the infantry and cavalry corps from being their colonel\\'s and captains little private military and enterprises into permanent government run organizations. This is important as rationing and new horses and bedding and clothing was now on the crown\\'s dime.  It would establish a system of administration and accountability for military funds and would end a very long practice of abuse at the hands of aristocratic officers starving their men while they ate like kings. There would be  quartiers-maitres  (quartermasters) to handle these records and supplies distributions. From this came much more reform such as the formation of a military police and a militia reorganization. \\n The next was from Claude Louis de Saint-Germain. He would form territorial divisions and stopped the sale of officer commissions. As in, you could no longer just show up with a lot of money and say you were an officer now. He would create ten more military schools and would overall create a more tight and organized military.  There is so much more but I think you\\'re getting the picture now, the French military would begin to become a very respected group in a matter of years. Their staff officers and artillerymen in particular were admired and their infantry and cavalry divisions began looking damn respectable. The force sent to assist the United States was nothing short of an efficient and well administered machine. \\n The artillery was a peculiar area of the French military. It was straddling the world of being attached to infantry battalions and only achieved independent status in 1774 but even then they were not fully independent arms until 1793. These men were expected to pass both written and practical tests and because of the erm, less honorable and less distinguished nature of the burgeoning field less noblemen pushed their way into these fields to break that up. These officers neither had high birth but had to get into these tough schools on intelligence and hard work. This would include one Corsican who you may know named Napoleon Bonaparte. \\n It was, however, too little too late. Louis XV nor Louis XVI supported these efforts and, most of the time, actively thwarted the progress because of general incompetence. Choiseul would be fired because a Du Barry would be more sympathetic to Louis XV\\'s wishes. Segur\\'s work, who strengthened the Artillery Corps and organized the Army Staff Corps to a more meritocratic system would be almost completely reversed  with Louis XVI announcing a decree that all Officers must have four generations of noble ancestry and submit documents to prove it. Pierre-Joseph Bourcet would be scoffed at when he attempted to implement examinations and a probationary period for officers, as noblemen were clearly good enough already. \\n Right up until 1792, Louis XVI had absolute control over half of the officer appointments and promotions. Like I said, he was completely and incompetent and, moreover, did not really seem to care. He would be influenced by none other than Marie Antoinette in this regard, and it would be disastrous. The chasm between officers and the regular men would deepen. The four generations requirement would extend to officers of provincial militias and even the renowned and highly prestigious Artillery and Engineer schools which had previously been mostly untouched by the King\\'s antics. \\n Because every nobleman who wanted a position in the officer corps got it, there would be an enormous surplus of officers. As in, the needs of the aristocracy, not the size of the army, was what determined the number of officers. Such a surplus of officers would cause efficiency issues to say the least. Many would be underworked, did not care for the military life, and did not care for their men. They would often take no time with their men and leave the training and drills for their  officers de fortune  and Majors, who often had no estate and were paid by commission. With absolutely no upward mobility available to them they would also lose their zeal and stop giving a crap as well. \\n In 1787, for an army of 180,000 men (9400 of them officers), there were 18 Marshals, 225 lieutenant generals, and 538 field marshals. Fredrick the Great has 103 generals for 195,000 men, for reference. Their lavish lifestyles would block the roads with massive baggage trains. The poor soldiers, usually hungry and with little morale because their officers didn\\'t give two craps, would have to guard these trains full of food and luxuries for the officers who  did not do anything all day.  Most Captains wouldn\\'t know the name of even 5 of their men, as there were at times over 30 or 40 lieutenant colonel\\'s per regiment! These men would live in \\n > * . . . veritable cities of luxury, with their attendants, purveyors, bakers, butchers, merchants of all sorts, theatrical troupes, comedians, comediennes, and their chambermaids and other young laides who are not at all washerwomen or vivandieres [as in, prostitutes] . . . Life at headquarters went like a country fair.\" ^[2] \\n Another important factor that would cause the mutiny of the men toward their king was the issue of pay. I\\'m sure you could have seen this coming -- first lack of food, and now lack of pay. It was already petty change these men were getting but to tack onto that officers would take \\'cuts\\' from their mens pay (illegally but nobody cared) and would disguise it as inflation or phantom purchases. To top this all off it was not unheard of for men being forced to \\'indefinitely\\' continue to serve after their 6-8 year tenure. The result of this was catastrophic -- NCO\\'s and grenadiers which should be formed of the most experienced and veteran men who  want  to come back would not. They had no low level leadership or experienced men. Lastly, desertion. Sometimes as much as  one third  of the enlisted men in one year would desert. \\n This would create even  more  shadowy practices. God it\\'s just a race to the bottom with these people, huh? The recruiters were nothing short of menaces to get more men to fill up the holes left by deserters who were leaving for the Austrian and Prussian armies.  Racoleur\\'s  were men who would lure and even kidnap men, force them into buildings, and wait until an authorized recruiter came and  bought  the men. Combine this with the fact that there was an increasing number of foreigners acting as independent regiments within the military who would be paid significantly more and treated much better (mainly because they were not being treated by French officers), it would create an aura of spite toward the French regiments and an allure for the German and Swiss ones -- which would cause many men to desert and fake a German/Swiss jargon and try to get into the foreign regiments for better treatment and pay. \\n The last big change before the revolution was in 1778 which created a pseudo-national army. Service was 4 years and would be mandatory. No voluntary enlistments or substitutions permitted and it would be chosen by lottery. Each parish across France was given a quota and they had to meet that quota and this would recreate that system of inequality that I spoke of early. Nobility and clergymen would be \\'excused\\' very informally and in their place, to fill the quota, married and old men would be forced into their place. This pissed a lot of people off. \\n Ultimately, the army had been the  Royal  Army -- a King\\'s Army -- and not the nation of France\\'s. For all its great attempts at reforms and the devotions of the men who tried to save it, in summary, it suffered from four great trials: \\n \\n Lacking an organized and proper means of recruiting it turned into chaos. The army would take what men it could via persuasion, fraud, and force and filled it ranks with foreign deserters, criminals, and young men who were nothing short of kidnapped. \\n \\n The gulf between the officer and the men became a widening abyss as the opportunity for promotion became increasingly thinner as ranking up became more of a sycophantic duty than a meritocratic and dedication one. No experienced men wanted to stay as NCO\\'s and Grenadiers when they knew they would never achieve anything as the system was rigged. \\n \\n The officers set no good example for their men. They would fail to take care of their men and would rather spend their time in brothels and what was essentially a traveling circus sipping wine than spend time with their men and would resort to harsh and unfair punishments in lieu of actual respect from their men and leadership on their parts. \\n \\n There was no national spirit or patriotism. The King was its \"center and motivating force\" but Louis XVI had no comprehension of that responsibility. Like a medieval ruler he put the trust in his nobles and gave no thought to his common soldiers. \\n \\n \\n Thus, the army became yet another and perhaps the most volatile bed of revolutionary urges. One full of restless, mistreated, and unhappy men -- men who were given muskets, horses, artillery and armor with the training to use them. The criminal and deserters, the agitated NCO\\'s and  officers de fortune  who could not perform their duties and hated their aristocratic overlords, helped along with wine and silver sent ripples through the military and these men were ready for trouble. \\n The saddest part of this all, honestly, was that Louis XVI had his fate in his hand this entire time. There were still traditions of victory and loyalty and if Louis had, even in this last hour, shown a modicum of force and presence along with at least an elementary level of respect and understanding for the well-being of his soldiers they likely would have rallied the army to him in this period. However, he was a passive and dimwitted soul who knew no better and it would be his pampered  Gardes Francaises  who would turn against him first. Barely anyone raised a weapon in his defense except his redcoat Swiss Guard -- who he would abandon to be trampled and beaten by the Parisian mob. \\n TL;DR:  At least for the military (which can be argued as the most influential part of France to revolt against the King and the Nobility), it was not some abstract sense of \"rich vs poor.\" Many nobles honestly weren\\'t even that rich and their nobility came from land ownership and heritage. Where it stemmed from was, ultimately, the noble privileges and the abuses performed by the nobility -- nobles who were generally incompetent and overall shitty people toward their men.

In the Fifth Republic system, the President is elected by the people, and the Prime Minister is nominated by the President. Usually, the Prime Minister belongs to the party who has a majority in Parliament. This is not a rule, the President is free to do otherwise, but it makes the country effectively ungovernable. \\n Before 2002, the Presidents would serve 7-year terms and the Deputies (congresspeople) would serve 5-year terms. This meant that Parliamentarian elections could happen in the middle of a Presidential term, and if the President had made his party unpopular through his action, could lead to backlash against his party at the ballot box. \\n These periods were difficult for the government in internal matters, and the shortening of the President\\'s term to 5 years starting in 2002 is widely seen as an attempt to synchronize the Parliamentarian and Presidential elections, so that the President\\'s party would be granted a majority almost everytime. As of today, this hasn\\'t failed. \\n Now, on to your question itself: \\n During the  First Cohabitation , one can\\'t discount the effect of Mitterrand\\'s authoritarian character. He was a man who wouldn\\'t share power, and for a few months refused to allow Chirac to act or speak on the international stage. Chirac protested, privately, and unwritten rules were drawn up where press conferences dealing with international matters had the two men speak jointly. \\n However, through political and personal maneuvers, Mitterrand quickly took back the foreign-policy power for himself. In 1986, during the American air strikes on Libya, Mitterrand and his advisors met wit hWashington envoys to reassure them that \"Mitterrand is still the boss\" and thus the person to contact in order to secure France\\'s support in the region. Chirac tried to appear publicly as the decision-maker, claiming some foreign-policy measures as his, but advisors and envoys covertly agreed that the decisions came from Mitterrand only. At the same time, Mitterrand was willing to let Chirac take some of the credit, content to  \"let the government govern\" , be discreet, and wait for them to make a political mistake and take the advantage for the 1988 Presidential election. \\n In fact, on foreign-policy matters, Jacques Chirac quickly found himself agreeing with François Mitterrand\\'s decisions, even in the face of his own party and government. \\n The  Second Cohabitation  was a more balanced affair, as Mitterrand\\'s authoritarian tendencies were offset by his declining health. He had to take leaves of absence from power more and more frequently,  and Mr. Balladur became a \"Vice-President\" more than an a Prime Minister. \\n The foreign-policy scene of the time was mostly dominated by France\\'s involvement in the Rwandan conflict and resulting genocide. There was little disagreement between the two on military intervention to evacuate foreign citizens, Operation Amaryllis. However, Balladur disagreed with Operation Turquoise, the \"humanitarian intervention\" decided by Mitterrand to establish a safe zone in South Rwanda. The disagreement was made privately, though, in a letter. \\n However, there is an episode that highlights the balance of power at the time: in 1994, during an African tour, Balladur spent time in Goma, the biggest muster point in the DRC (then Zaire) for Rwandan refugees. Mitterrand was furious; in his mind Balladur was usurping his role as Head of State. His reaction was immediate: in the D-Day 50th Anniversary ceremonies, later this year, Mitterrand made a show of favoring Jacques Chirac, his old enemy and Balladur\\'s political rival, spending time with him publicly and privately and snubbing Balladur. This  quasi-monarchist show of favor was typical of Mitterrand, and the French media at the time picked up on it with glee. \\n TL;DR: The \"sanctity\" of the position of French President, combined with Mitterrand\\'s natural authority and mastery of politics, prevented disagreements from spilling over into the public and from being resolved in any other way than Mitterrand quickly regaining the upper hand. \\n The Third Cohabitation, from 1997-2002 and the only one I remember clearly as a French citizen, was much more antagonistic, but because it\\'s under the 20-year threshold for /r/AskHistorians rules, I won\\'t go into it right away. \\n Sources: \\n \"Les derniers jours de François Mitterrand\", Christophe Barbier, 1998\\n\"Edouard Balladur au chevet du Rwanda\", Diplomatie, Jul. 28 1994 (Newspaper article)\\n\"Mitterrand et Chirac ont appris à se connaître\", Libération, May 22nd 1995 (Newspaper article, interview with Jacques Attali)\\n\"François Mitterrand vu de Washington\", Le Nouvel Observateur, Aug. 22nd 2010 (Newspaper article) \\n',\n  0),\n ('I think it\\'s worth thinking about what Romanticizing is. I would argue that summing up Napoleon (or any historical figure) as ultimately good or ultimately bad, is to give expression to how the summarizing critic  feels  about that figure. And to summarize a figure based on how you feel is to romanticize. Whether he\\'s portrayed as hero or tyrant, both are romanticizations. So, the question is: how do you assess figures without romanticizing them? \\n You do this by grounding your assessment in a criteria of some sort. So, in this case, you would say something like: using the Geneva convention as a standard, Napoleon is a war criminal. \\n What should become immediately obvious is that a negative assessment of Napoleon according to the Geneva convention does not contradict an assessment of Napoleon according to, say, a criteria based on the relative improvement of civil institutions measured against general welfare (it\\'s not hard to improve on the Terror). They are simply assessments according to different standards. \\n And you should probably be thinking something like, \"well, can\\'t we combine all these different standards and create some sort or summarizing conclusion about him as a good or bad figure in history?\" Maybe, but no one can agree by exactly what means we should go about doing this. So, the very possibility of a summarizing moral assessment is itself an act of faith, based in our desire that such an assessment ought be possible. Which brings us right back to romanticizing. \\n So, why do people select a positive romantic over a negative romantic for Napoleon? Because their personal selection of preferred moral criteria, on balance, justifies that assessment. \\n TL;DR: for most people Napoleon is a mixed bag and whether that bag pans out good or bad is mostly a consequence of each critic\\'s priorities. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Before answering your question, I think it may behoove one to know a few details regarding Mecelle. \\n The word \\'Mecelle\\' itself is an anglicized version of the Arabic  مجلۀ احکام عدلیه, which translates (roughly) to \"provisions of judiciary law\". Mecelle encompasses the judiciary aspect of a more broad set of socio-legal reforms included in the  Gülhane Decree . Now, on to your questions: \\n >Why was the Mecelle not adopted throughout the Muslim world? \\n First of all, the notion that Mecelle was the Ottomans\\' attempt to \"codify Sharia\" is slightly misleading. Mecelle was an attempt to put into legal practice the  moderate civil laws  that were influenced mainly by the most centrist of Sunni  Madhhabs . However, you are correct in that Mecelle was a more westernized take on Hanafi principles, which greatly influenced the reluctance of Muslim rulers during the decline of the Ottoman Empire to implement them. \\n In short, the obstinance of local Muslim rulers in Greece and in the Balkans, combined with the general bleak outlook of the Ottoman Empire\\'s, eventually led to the rebellion of their respective populations, who had been promised equality in both civil and penal law. Greece was the first to rebel in the early 1820\\'s, followed several decades later by Serbia/Montenegro, Romania, and Bulgaria, among others. To your next question: \\n >Were there efforts similar to the Mecelle? \\n On a social level, no. \\n While there were reformations attempted prior to the Tanzimât era of the 19th century, they mainly centered on military changes, such as the attempted modernization of the Ottoman army made by Selim III, toward the latter end of the 18th century. Some of these efforts succeeded, while most were hampered if not quelled completely by religious authorities on the grounds of theodicy. It is worth noting, however, that Jordan, Lebanon, and Kuwait have remained relatively secular throughout the ~1.5 centuries since Mecelle was implemented, and have more or less retained Mecelle as a framework for their respective civil justice systems. \\n While my post was quite long, it still only provides a cursory understanding of the aforementioned ideologies and the macro-level events that they influenced. The Ottoman Empire was vast and diverse not only in landmass but in cultures, so to say that \\'x\\' event was caused/influenced by solely \\'y\\' thing often is to misrepresent the situation. \\n However, if you\\'d like to read further into the subject, I suggest taking a look at [ The Economic and Social History of the Ottoman Empire, Volumes I and II ]( by Inalcık and Quataert, along with [ The proposed political, legal and social reforms in the Ottoman Empire and other Mohammadan states ]( by Mouvali Chiragh Ali, both of which delve further into Tanzimat and how it influenced the decline of the Ottoman Empire. You will, however, have to use a library to check out the books or download an ebook version. \\n Anyway, to give a  TL;DR: The fact that the Muslim world didn\\'t respond well to Mecelle is owed largely to the fact that Mecelle was viewed by Ottoman-Muslim rulers as a western bastardization of Muslim principles. This viewpoint doesn\\'t come as a surprise considering the Ottoman Empire was vastly declining at the time of Mecelle\\'s proposal. Mecelle lives on today in already-moderate countries such as Jordan and Kuwait.

A brief review of stock market crashes will show that only the 29 crash was followed by a depression of this magnitude. It's not a closed question by any means, but any attempt at answering it needs to look at worldwide conditions in interwar period and not just focus on a single event. \\n > We do not yet have our hands on the Grail by any means, but during the past fifteen years or so substantial progress toward the goal of understanding the Depression has been made. This progress has a number of sources, including improvements in our theoretical framework and painstaking historical analysis. To my mind, however, the most significant recent development has been a change in the focus of Depression research, from a traditional emphasis on events in the United States to a more comparative approach that examines the experiences of many countries simultaneously. \\n -Bernanke \\n A very strong hypothesis currently is that the depression was caused primarily by a massive decrease in world wide money supply. This triggered deflationary financial crises and put people out of work as price / wage levels failed to adjust to the sharp drop in money supply. This occurred due to conditions unique to the interwar world economy. (As opposed to the earlier hypotheses popular during the 60's which simply blamed contractionary Fed policy and didn't consider the operation of the international gold standard.) \\n The international gold standard was reconstituted after a period of suspension during WW1. It was expected that it would operate reasonably smoothly as it did before (a depression of the magnitude of the 30's did not occur under the pre-war gold standard), but conditions had changed. \\n To be sure some of the changes were deliberate. The US Fed chose to contract money supply starting in 1928 (as shown in a drop in the money multiplier) which counteracted a significant net inflow of gold. However there was a basic deflationary trend wherein economic growth outstripped gold supplies (see Eichengreen). Beyond that a wave of banking crises struck the developed world starting in 1931 and central banks reacted to this through more contractionary monetary policy. Each country attempted to hoard gold, to increase the ratio of gold backing actual money supply. \\n This differed from the operation of the pre-war gold standard where countries coordinated with one another to prop up any one that suffered banking panics. On the stability of the dollar in the 1890's: \\n > The stability of the prewar gold standard was instead the result of two very different factors: credibility and cooperation. Credibility is the confidence invested by the public in the government's commitment to a policy. The credibility of the gold standard derived from the priority attached by governments to the maintenance of balance‐of‐payments equilibrium...\\n>\\n> First, the stability of the dollar as much as the stability of sterling hinged on international cooperation. The efforts of the Belmont‐Morgan syndicate were successful only because European countries were willing to part with the gold required by the United States. Second, international cooperation could be arranged in the absence of a central bank, but only through highly public and potentially embarrassing channels. \\n -Eichengreen \\n After WW1, these conditions changed. Within each individual country, the usual debtors (the working class) gained more power at the expense of the usual creditors (owners). Wage levels and unemployment became hot political issues to a degree unseen before. The early interwar years were characterized by explosive inflation in a number of countries which lasted into the mid 20's. Reforms were then introduced to insulate monetary policy from public pressure, but this also had the perverse effect of reducing central bank autonomy, and damaging the cooperative gold standard. Political disputes (such as over war reparations) and divergent theories of policy further contributed to the breakdown of cooperation. \\n > With the erosion of credibility, international cooperation became even more important than before the war. Yet the requisite level of cooperation was not forth‐coming. Three obstacles blocked the way: domestic political constraints, international political disputes, and incompatible conceptual frameworks. Domestic interest groups with the most to lose were able to stave off adjustments in economic policy that would have facilitated international cooperation. The international dispute over war debts and reparations hung like a dark cloud over all international negotiations, contaminating efforts to redesign and manage the gold standard system cooperatively. The competing conceptual frameworks employed in different countries prevented policymakers from reaching a common understanding of their economic problem, much less from agreeing on a solution. \\n -Eichengreen \\n Okay, but you say, money supply according to basic theory has no effect. Cutting the money supply in half should just result in all prices and wages getting slashed in half and everything goes on as normal. So the second piece of the puzzle is why nominal shocks should produce real shocks. One possible explanation is that long term financial instruments (a mortgage for example) are set in nominal terms and not usually indexed to price levels. A drop in money supply tends to hurt debtors as the nominal amounts they owe do not shift automatically. This triggers a wave of loan repayment by whatever means possible and decreases economic activity in real terms. The repayment of loans (possibly through illiquid collateral) can then hurt banks as well since nominal assets are now replaced by real assets (with now low price levels) and put the solvency of the bank itself in jeopardy, triggering further crises and creating something of a feedback loop. \\n This debt-deflation argument is somewhat novel, but a longstanding observation has been that real prices and wages do not adjust instantaneously to money supply. Just looking at raw data without getting into the specific mechanisms of price adjustment: \\n > First, during the worldwide deflation of 1930 and 1931, nominal wages worldwide fell much less slowly than (wholesale) prices, leading to significant increases in the ratio of nominal wages to prices. Associated with this sharp increase in real wages were declines in employment and output. \\n -Bernanke \\n It took some time for countries to leave the gold standard for complex reasons unique to each country, but when it did happen it was eventually accompanied by recovery. \\n Okay so this is a huge rambling wall of text, but TLDR: \\n \\n The pre war gold standard was relatively stable as nations cooperated with one another to maintain convertability. \\n WW1 happens. \\n For a variety of complex reasons including international disputes, divergent national experiences and theories of monetary policy, shifting powers of political interest groups, a shift in balance of trade in favor of certain countries (US), international cooperation broke down. \\n Policy and events triggered a general worldwide contraction of money supply. \\n For a variety of complex reasons, the financial system and pricing mechanisms did not adjust to this contraction, and therefore real output and employment collapsed. \\n \\n This is a massive oversimplification of the literature on the subject, so here's some further reading: \\n [ The Macoreconomics of the Great Depression: A Comparative Approach ]( Bernanke \\n Golden Fetters: The Gold Standard and the Great Depression , Eichengreen \\n [ The Nation in Depression ]( Romer \\n Freedom From Fear: The American People in Depression and War , Kennedy \\n\",\n  0),\n ('The problem with that source (besides bing Wikipedia) is that homosexuality as a concept simply didn\\'t exist in the 1650s.

I would argue that the tipping point comes later than most see it - in the reigns of Georges III and IV. In the reign of William IV there was a last gasp of monarchical power. Under Victoria ministers and parliament achieved a supremacy they have yet to lose. \\n Short answer :  Power is balanced between monarch as executive and parliament as legislative  in the Glorious Revolution; with some rumblings this works until the early 19th century when a combination of long-term (e.g. the rising middle-class) and short-term (the unpopularity of George IV) factors combine to decrease the de facto power of the monarchy, chiefly its influence over parliament. Victoria lets ministers get on with things to the point where it becomes so conventional that no monarch since has felt the need to get their hands dirty. \\n The key starting point to this question is the  Glorious Revolution , which although we date it to 1688 most of the definitive events were in 89. It arguably continued through the reign of William III as the constitutional wrangling and horsetrading was sorted out - the Act of Settlement being an example of that. The purpose of the GR was  to achieve a balanced constitution  i.e. both the monarch and parliament had different powers and were designed to check each other. Remember England was emerging from many decades of civil strife and veering from radical republicanism/despotism under Cromwell to the absolutist tendencies (as they saw it) of James II. So the purpose of this was to achieve a  stable political settlement with both monarchy and aristocracy balancing each other out.  If you read any British political theorist or commentator in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries you will very often see them refer to the balanced constitution with great pride as it was seen as the progenitor of British ascent and success. \\n So all through the 18th century we have this balanced constitution in play. What did it mean in theory? Constitutionally the king could hire and fire ministers; get rid of administrations he didn’t like; and he had a veto, or a controlling influence on foreign policy. This was called the  royal prerogative  An example of this would be when George II engaged Great Britain in land conflict on the European Continent during the War of Austrian Succession– which it was not wont to do if it could help it. It was also the last time a British monarch personally led troops into battle, see \\n Importantly though this was the exception: Anne and the first two Georges were pretty hands off monarchs who, whilst they had the right to interfere in policy, particularly foreign and military, rarely did so. Politicians generally ran things (see Robert Walpole) but, as we see we the above example, if a monarch decided to get involved with government business he or she was constitutionally in their right to do so. \\n So it was a real shock to the system for Parliamentarians when George III ascended to the throne in 1760 because he sought to make full use of his powers as head of state unlike his predecessors. The Whig oligarchy had grown used to being in exclusive charge and resented George’s interference. There was rhetoric emanating from parliament in the early part of his reign comparing George to the Jacobite monarchs, chiefly James II, and accusing him of absolutist tendencies. \\n We can see the beginnings in the reign of George III of the decline of monarchical power.  The importance of the patronage of the monarch to the outcome of legislative votes, the formation of governments, and general policymaking, was still very important, but becoming less so. I would also stress the fact that George was permanently mad for the last 10 years of his tenure and his son (future George IV) was deeply unpopular and did much to tarnish the role of the monarch. Combine this with extra-parliamentary political forces – chiefly  a rising middle-class  which wielded great economic clout and was beginning to seek admittance into the political nation; as well as phenomena like  the press, and public opinion. \\n In terms of high politics,though,  party was beginning to supplant monarch  as the arbiter and patron of individual politicians. This could be seen in the example of Lord Liverpool who informed the newly crowned George IV in 1820 that if he dismissed Lord Liverpool his Cabinet would resign with him. This marked a dramatic change as  it had previously been conventional for ministers to consider themselves accountable to the head of state, not the head of government. \\n The last successful significant use of monarchical power  was during the wrangling over the Great Reform Act of 1832 which essentially enfranchised the urban middle classes. The Whig government under Earl Grey (yes him of tea fame) successfully steered their bill through the Commons only for many Tory peers to threaten to vote against it in the Lords. William IV was persuaded by his ministers to threaten to ennoble enough new peers who would support the bill. This induced the Tories to back down – better allow one Act to go through and retain their dominance in the Lords than lose that dominance altogether. \\n The moment when many contemporaries commentators realised the monarchy had lost its teeth  was the last time a monarch attempted to form a government which did not command a majority in the House of Commons. This was when William IV, concerned at its radical reforming agenda, dismissed the Whig ministry of Earl Grey in 1835 and appointed a minority Conservative administration under Robert Peel. It lasted less than six months, was defeated in Parliament again and again, and no monarch has ever tried to go against Parliament since. \\n TL; DR: After the Glorious Revolution power is balanced between monarch and parliament, the practical power of the monarch declines under Georges III and IV and is in practice gone by Victoria – though in theory it remains. \\n Sources: \\n For the Glorious Revolution see: \\n‘1688: The First Modern Revolution,’ Pincus;\\n‘The Anglo-Dutch Moment,’ ed.

Obviously we need to draw a line between the modern field of history and the nebulous awareness and discussion of past events that has always been a part of the human consciousness.  If a group of people have no conception of a difference between their historical past and a mythological past, then where do we draw the line between history and theology?  Are Jewish biblical scholars historians if they believe that the events described in the Genesis are historically accurate?  If they are not, then what about medieval chroniclers who regularly included accounts of religious miracles taken at face value?  And then there is the question of what is an average person and what society are we talking about, both of which obviously need to be answered before attempting to say anything except the most useless generalities. \\n I\\'m not going to try to touch most of that.  I\\'m going to answer a simpler question, and only with regards to western society.  At what point did a concept of history as an independent and interpretive discipline become part of the general scope of an \"education\"? \\n The answer to that comes in the Renaissance and with the rise of a very broad and influential intellectual movement called \"Humanism\" or \"Renaissance Humanism\" to which we owe many of the ideas that differentiate us from the medieval mind.  Until this point, a civic education consisted of two groups of disciplines, the \"Trivium\": Grammar, Rhetoric, and Logic which had formed the core of an education in Classical Antiquity, and the later Medieval addition of the \"Quadrivium\": Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, and Astronomy.  If you were the son of, say, a French duke in the mid or late middle ages, those seven disciplines likely formed the core of your intellectual training. \\n Humanism, which we tend to say began with Francis Petrarch in Italy in the 14th century, was an intellectual movement that challenged the status quo in many different arenas.  One of its earliest and most important principles was the concept of \"Ad Fontes\", meaning to the source.  While you and I think of the Roman Empire as having fallen in 410 CE, Medieval Europe tended to conflate Christendom and Roman Civilization (en route to a lot of very interesting notions on the fate of the world and the coming of God\\'s kingdom), and they believed that the rule of Rome continued in the form of the Roman Church, and that the mechanism of rule had simply transitioned from the temporal means of the empire to the spiritual means of the Church.  They believed that Rome, as a figurative concept, was still alive and well and that medieval Christians did not differ a great deal from their earlier Roman counterparts.  It took Petrarch and his study of ancient texts to reveal the true rift that had grown between this assumption and reality.  He coined the term \\'the dark ages\\' to refer to the ongoing era of intellectual regression that separated Medieval scholars from their Classical counterparts.  As some of his ideas took hold, there was a natural impetus to relearn what had been lost and to study ancient texts in their original form, i.e. go to the source, rather than read recent productions in the oversimplified Medieval Latin (often referred to as Vulgar Latin).  This and the ideas that arose in its aftermath brought about many of the things that we now place under the umbrella of the Renaissance.  One of those things was a challenge to Medieval scholasticism in universities.  The Trivium and Quadrivium were reformed into the broader collection of \"studias humanitatis,\" or the Humanities.  Among them was history, and it has been there ever since.  Obviously methodologies have evolved, but I\\'m sure you can see why the notions such as \\'ad fontes\\' that inspired so many new ways of thinking would lead directly into a more attentive and factually rigorous attention to the past, its events, and its ongoing processes. \\n What I\\'ve just given you is a very traditional account of one answer to your question.  As I said, there are innumerable possible answers depending on how you choose to draw your dividing lines and who you really want to talk about.  Hopefully this is part of what you wanted to know. \\n TL;DR For western culture, it happens in the Renaissance. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Although I argue that Confucianism is not a religion, I would say that this question is similar to ones along the lines of \"Why is Christianity the source of our world\\'s problems?\" Confucianism itself was not really the cause of stagnation, but rather the problem stemmed from corruption, greed, and the general follies of man. To say that Confucianism naturally held back the Chinese from \\'westernizing\\' is incorrect - the Jesuits saw so many similarities between Confucianism and Christianity that they regarded it as being one of the places where conversion could progress most smoothly. \\n Confucianism was the State philosophy of the Han and Song Dynasties, both of which saw incredible innovativeness in the fields of science and technology. In particular, the Song reorganized land distribution to triple food output (despite having half the land of the Tang, they were able to support a population twice the size) and were producing steel at a rate that was unmatched until the British of the early 19th century. \\n Leading up to the stagnation, China\\'s weaknesses were caused largely due to attempts to keep China isolated, an increasingly reactionary and conservative attitude that flourished during the end of Qianlong\\'s reign. This was in part due to rampant corruption under Heshen, Qianlong\\'s favorite court official (and rumored lover), who siphoned off about 20% of the Empire\\'s annual revenue into his private estate. The nation was highly destabilized by Heshen\\'s nepotism and corruption froze the bureaucracy, and in an age where Europe was literally steaming ahead, this was a key period in which China was overtaken in technology and administrative innovativeness. \\n If you look at the beginnings of the \"stagnation\" period, you will see that many of the more progressive people were actually Confucian scholars. Men like Feng Guifan and Zeng Guofan were scholars and spearheaded the Self Strengthening Movement. Other leading scholars, like Kang Youwei, were behind the Hundred Day\\'s Reform. What resulted in the failure of both of these were, again, corruption and political intrigues. The Self Strengthening Movement lasted for about 30 years and was an attempt to reconcile Confucian ideals with Western conceptions of modernity. It was highly successful in building up the Chinese military-industrial complex, and during China\\'s first war with the modernized Japan (1894-5), the world expected China to win. China\\'s defeat lay in the corruption that resulted in ammunition being filled with sawdust rather than gunpowder, ships missing essential parts, insufficient funds to pay soldiers, etc. In fact, during this time, some of China\\'s warships rivaled those of Germany in size. \\n The Hundred Day\\'s Reform failed because of Cixi\\'s fear of losing power. The resulting power struggle represented the last time that Imperial China really had a chance to reform. By the time of the Republican Era, Confucianism as a state ideology had gone out the door, yet the corruption in the Guomindang not only lost them the Civil War to the Communists, but also drove the nation into its darkest days since the Mongolian Invasions. \\n Tl;dr Confucianism is not the cause, corruption and human weakness were responsible. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"It's a unfair to say that the countries of East Asia didn't have an industrial revolution because they did, just later than England. \\n One of the main reasons England was able to industrialize first was because they had an obscene amount of capital that they amassed from exploiting their colonies (especially India). They also were able to import food from the colonies, which made it feasible for people to come off of the land and to go work in the factories. They also had steam power to exploit to power their factories. \\n Korea wasn't able to industrialize because it didn't have the capital. Japan, thanks to being a feudal state already had the systems in place in order to modernize/industrialize during the Meiji period. Because Feudal lords were always in competition with each other, Japan had already built up a large amount of capital necessary to being industrialization. \\n Korea and China, on the other hand, didn't have that. They both (especially China) had large, centralized governments. People depended on the land to survive, and wouldn't have been easily convinced to give it up to build factories. China had, for thousands of years, been the head of the region and had many countries paying tribute to it. However, in both Korea and China there was a lot of corruption within the city officials, so a lot of money was siphoned off. \\n China and Korea did not value merchants in their confucian system.

Making money was considered to be unconfucian, and there wasn't a large incentive on making capital because of this. \\n The tl;dr here is that England had systems in place through their empire that allowed it to industrialize first.

The First and Second Opium war between England and China led to China's defeat, and forced them to sign unequal treaties leading them to open several of their cities up for foreigners, and included a one hundred year lease of Hong Kong.  Commodore Matthew Perry opened Japan up for trade, by making them sign unequal treaties as well. \\n Some of the ruling class in Korea saw the writing on the wall, and wanted Korea to modernize as well, which led to the Gwangmu reforms, but were quickly shot down by the royal family, and had most of the reformers branded as traitors.  Japan, on the other hand, saw the advantages of becoming an Imperial power, and the disadvantages of becoming a colony, and sent out the Iwakura misison to teach them how to modernize and become an Imperial power as well.  Shortly after this, Japan won the Sino-Japanese war, and then the Russo-Japanese war, eliminating any power who would attempt to claim Korea as their own.  Japan made Korea a protectorate in 1905, and then annexed it in 1910.  Japan wanted to develop Korea as a colony, and spent a great deal of resources modernizing Korea with railways, cars, electricity, mass media, and universal education. \\n TL;DR  China and Japan were modernized by being forced to trade with foriegn powers.

On July 4th, the text of the Declaration of Independence (the first draft was written by Thomas Jefferson of Virginia, and then amended by the other members of the committee: John Adams of Massachusetts, Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania, Roger Sherman of Connecticut, and Robert Livingston of New York) was adopted after amendments by the Continental Congress (one of these was removal of a passage expressly denouncing slavery).  The Declaration had been mostly prepared in advance in anticipation of a vote for independence, as the question had been moved by Richard Henry Lee of Virginia on June 7th and delayed until July 1st, partly to give the Declaration committee time to prepare a draft. It is believed by some historians that the engrossed Declaration copy that is in the National Archives wasn't signed until early August, and then in a piecemeal fashion. John Hancock, as President of the Continental Congress, almost certainly signed first. \\n TL; DR July 1: Committee of the Whole approves Lee Resolution for independence. \\n July 2: Continental Congress declares independence and the Declaration was introduced. \\n July 3: Declaration amended. \\n July 4: Declaration adopted. \\n Sources: This general timeline has been generally agreed to by historians.

She was no longer the main continental power of Europe as Prussia had destroyed them in the Seven Years war with great consistency. So, several within France were looking to reform France's army to ensure that it wouldn't be defeated again. So people like the Comte de Guibert wrote essays on tactics in order to help bring change. Some of these ideas would argue the need for soldiers to fight in battalion over the line. \\n Experiments were done, and as you have noted, a battalion moving in column formation would be vulnerable to artillery and volley fire. However, a battalion moving in line would take longer to move and have difficulty maneuvering on the battlefield. So movement was decided to stay in line to ensure maximum fire power but movement off the battlefield would continue in line. \\n Everything changed with the Revolution. When the flight of nobility happened, the army was hit hard (the infantry had the middle of the road amount of losses with about 50% of officers leaving the army, officers at the time were required to have a minimum of two generations of nobility), so the government created a new tactical rule book which advocated a new formation called l'ordre mixte, [which I discuss here]( This became a standard battle formation during the early years of the Revolution with the idea that regular army companies would be in line formation while the conscripted infantry would be in column formation and use fanatical revolutionary spirit to attack the enemy lines while the regular infantry would hold the line. \\n From here, we go to Napoleon. Napoleon was famous for not being a creative tactician. We laud him as a genius leader but rarely did he use any concepts that were original to him. Under his command, he would often have his corps commanders use  l'ordre mixte  but they would often use whatever tactics they decided outside of his direct control. However, the use of the column is also dependent on use of French skirmishers to weaken the enemy lines and also a strong use of artillery to weaken the lines and cavalry to help follow up on the breach that might happen. \\n The tl;dr is that it isn't a BIG factor but it isn't a small factor. There are a lot of things that contribute to Napoleon's skill on the battlefield and the column isn't the most significant. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('I believe there is some connection between Mycenaean and Philistine pottery though gods only know where I read that.

It is true (basically) that common wages have stagnated since about 1973, and income inequality has grown more severe. (This can be attributed to many factors - mechanization of labor, the entrance of women fully into the workforce, policy decisions, etc.) So, in a relative sense, many are \"worse off\" than before. \\n However, in  absolute  terms, you could argue that wealth has increased noticeably. As an anecdotal example, I personally can afford, with a fairly humble income, a much materially richer lifestyle than a similarly placed person would have in 1970. I live in a nicer and larger home than would have been available to me back then, with a huge, inexpensive TV that gets 30x the number of channels, a  portable  phone that is tiny, a computer which links me to the internet, a microwave oven (still neat to me!), access to tons of media at affordable prices, and continually cheap food. So, in absolute terms, I am much better off than my 1970 equivalent would have been. \\n It should also be noted that the same economic system that created the income inequality of today also helped develop and produce (cheaply) the items I mentioned.

This has no scientific backing. While deadly radioactivity (fallout) does result from nuclear blasts, and the areas affected can be quite large from a human scale for multi-megaton blasts (e.g. here is the  Castle Bravo fallout pattern , from a global perspective these are quite limited. A major nuclear exchange [would spread a lot of radioactivity on the countries under attack and those immediately near to them]( But those clouds do no remain that radioactive long enough to be acutely deadly across the entire planet. There is such a thing as global fallout — and [you can trace the passage of the radioactivity across vast distances]( — but it is much much lower in activity than the \"local\" fallout. It can increase background cancer and birth defect rates but would not acutely kill people. \\n In the 1950s there were some calculations that suggested that on the order of 10 gigatons of nuclear detonations would increase the global background radioactivity to dangerous levels, but these were later revised upwards. This is about the closest one comes to a real  On the Beach  scenario. \\n Now this is not to say that global nuclear war in the 1960s would not lead to massive, global problems. They would, but they would probably be of a climatic variety, not a radiological one. Nuclear winter, not deadly clouds of radioactivity traveling the globe.

The First War pitted the Balkan League of Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Greece against the Ottoman Empire; it was a reaction to the Turkish defeat In the Italo-Turkish War, and to the coup of the Young Turks in Constantinople (Istanbul). \\n The Second War broke out shortly after the first, and was a reaction to the way territory had been \\'divied out\\'. Romania, Greece, Serbia and the Turks subsequently attacked the Bulgarians, seizing territory from them. This conflict ended in 1913 with the Treaty of London, which saw the Ottoman Empire, now under Enver Pasha\\'s Young Turks, reduced in it\\'s European holdings to roughly it\\'s current borders of Turkish Thrace. Serbia gained the areas of Kosovo, Vardar Macedonia and the eastern part of the Sanjak of Novi Pazar.

I\\'ve been askin\\'. \\n',\n  0),\n ('It\\'s a rather complicated answer. For the purpose of this post, I am lumping anarchism with communism, as especially in their early history, the two were very closely related. \\n In its most basic sense, opposition to communism, socialism, et al. began when the first real movements to implement them began, in the years of the Gilded Age. \\n Industrialization made a very small number of people very rich very fast. You have to understand that differences in wealth between the poorest of the poor and the richest of the rich have been much smaller until relatively recent history. Of the inflation adjusted richest people in history, nearly all of them have lived in the past 200 or 300 years. \\n And most of them lived in the 1800\\'s. A quick look at wikipedia shows that the Rothschilds might even have been  trillionaires  in today\\'s money. \\n Hence why so much socialist, anarchist, and communist literature dates from this period. \\n By this time, the fairly egalitarian United States that\\'s so doted upon in early American history was replaced by something not that far removed from European social structures, leading to pretty major social unrest. \\n Employers didn\\'t want to yield much to the labor movement, leading to violence. There are plenty enough examples to look up, so I won\\'t bore you with the details. People fought back, one thing led to another, and some of the people in control of the presses started demonizing the labor movement, while others, the capitalists. \\n Communism scared a lot of people, it did away with the status quo, religion, and plenty of staples of day to day life. It wasn\\'t hard to paint it in a light such that even people who it might have helped despised it. For plenty of reasons, mainly to get them back to work and perhaps to show would-be revolutionaries that revolution was not needed for change, companies and government gradually started yielding to worker demands, the 8 hour work week, an end to child labor, and later, minimum wage. This was what\\'s known as the progressive age. \\n Then, suddenly, world war one. US didn\\'t get in on the fighting until later on, but it was an exceptionally strange period to people living at the time. The US hadn\\'t been in a war in over 50 years, let alone the bloodiest conflict the world had yet seen, but there it was. As a rude interruption to the return to normalcy, or even to war time life, you have the Bolshevik revolution in Russia. \\n That ushered in the first red scare, the less well known forerunner to the one we\\'re more familiar with. In the early days of communism, it was nearly inseparable from the idea of world-revolution. Communists, socialist, labor activists all, became objects of suspicion in the eyes of the general public. Though it had proved itself receptive to the progressive age, communism was still something to be feared. This sort-of died down, ironically, when Stalin took over, mostly because of his idea of \"socialism in one country\" (which is the main source of conflict with Trotsky). \\n The second, more well known Red Scare, took place following world war two. The sudden seizure of half of Europe probably re-sparked dormant fears about world revolution, and hence, how bad communism was implied to be, seeds planted in earlier eras. What it also brought up was how horrible living in the Soviet Union turned out to be. \\n To put it simply, I think  Nineteen Eighty-Four  is the best bit of insight into the fears of the day that you could ever find. \\n Back to the original point: \\n TL;DR: \\n The US in general has had a problem with communism basically since shortly after communism was first conceived. However, it waxed and waned through the years, and only really became a fixture during and after the cold war. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"Well, it depends where you are. For the most part, the anglophone Caribbean was governed by centrist politicians throughout this period. The likes of Eric Williams in Trinidad and Tobago, Norman and Michael Manley and Hugh Shearer in Jamaica, and Errol Barrow in Barbados couldn't be described as Marxist revolutionaries. \\n That said, Marxism is a hugely influential philosopher - Williams in particular was a Marxist historian  par excellence . They simply made little or no move towards, say, a dictatorship of proletariat. In part this may have been because of the spectre of US influence, but I would also contend that the popular appetite simply wasn't there. \\n If you look at radical and revolutionary moments in West Indian history, they revolve around Black Power. The Rodney Riots in Jamaica stemmed from Shearer's exiling of radical academic Dr. Walter Rodney, and were led by students from the Mona campus of the University of the West Indies. The Black Power Revolt of 1970 in Trinidad and Tobago, in contrast, was largely over the perception that the country's wealth was not being fairly distributed to the black population. \\n Black Power is a pretty complex ideology, and has some limited overlap with Marxism, but I'd argue it's entirely distinct and I doubt anyone would contend that. Many of the issues may have been superficially similar, for example the feeling that blacks were economically disenfranchised and that redistribution of wealth was necessary, but it never went so far as the Cuban experience. Chief complaints instead were the foreign ownership of Caribbean assets and the belief that the islands were being transformed into picture postcard parodies for the benefit of the tourist dollar. \\n A few leading intellectuals, especially in the late colonial era, were active Marxists. CLR James was a hugely influential Trotskyite, whilst George Padmore served on the Moscow City Soviet. But by and large they were considered out-of-touch by the 1960s, revered for their genius but seen as purveying an ideology too distant to the realities of everyday life. \\n I doubt any of the later activists would have minded the comparison - Communists can, in almost every region I've studied, be relied upon to offer wholehearted and meaningful support to anti-racist and anti-imperialist groups - but they would have no doubt contended that before any international brotherhood of the workers could exist, racism would have to be ended. \\n On that note, however, it's worth noting that blackness and pigmentation have a somewhat loose relationship in the Caribbean. Starting with Article 14 of the 1805 Haitian Constitution, which declared all inhabitants of Haiti, 'regardless of colour', to be 'black', and more recently in Stokely Carmichael's assertion that Castro was the 'blackest man in the Caribbean', it's fair to say that Black Power wasn't just a racial movement, it was a movement of collective empowerment. \\n TL;DR: The West Indies had its own radical movements which seemed more relevant to their adherents than out-and-out Marxism \\n EDIT:  Many thanks for whoever gilded me for this - I'm surprisingly flattered that you think this is worth something! \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"Yes, I'm aware that Brazil was a Portuguese colony until the 1800s, but there were still in fact many Italian ventures.

The idea that the artistic qualities of photography have been extinguished due to technological advancement and the proliferation of digital photography and its associated software is ludicrous. It has only opened the door for more people. This is why. History always repeats itself, and the digital frontier is no different. \\n Photography’s first attempt at being considered an artistic form started out in direct imitation of painting, this style was called Pictorialism. Many people saw photography as a technical practice and nothing more at the time, but many artists loved the process and felt it had great potential as an artistic medium. They pushed things forward through manually manipulating images to “create” works similar to paintings but with photographic quality. This gave rise to the early 20th century’s gallery movement, namely through American Alfred Stieglitz and his gallery “291.” \\n Fast forward to the 1980s where digital manipulation of imagery begins to see use and digital cameras are beginning to be invented. Mind you, at the same time, automatic focus had just seen a commercial debut. People saw the digital advent as a new horizon for photography, but due to degradation of quality and cost, that it was not seen as any viable artistic alternative. \\n Fast forward to a time where the commercial market sees a digital SLR and people who were use to playing with point and shoot digital cameras have far more “creative” control. The common man experiences what is the digital equivalent of the Kodak Brownie revolution at home on their computer. Things got better, software caught up, artists see digital compete with film and finally the argument happens again except almost 100 years later. \\n It has never been about what you use to create, it has always been about how you use what you have to create. If you have a digital means to create an image that 20 years previously would have been only able to be made on nice film in a nice camera, why would you side step the technology in the name of Art? You wouldn’t. Art is an idea about making and communicating your vision and message to your audience through various mediums. In the end, the proliferation of imagery in our culture has changed a lot. But regardless of medium, art photography is still largely regarded as respectable and the effect of its content, not its means to an end process, is the judge. \\n Other Comparative Contexts: \\nWill 3D printing cause issues with sculpture artists?

In the Roman Empire, probably 99% of emperors had their head on some denomination . Augustus was on at least 20 different coins: Nero had reached at least 14. A few women would get their own coins, Cleopatra and Agrippina. Emperors female relatives such as Titus' daughter, Julia; Trajans sister Marciana and his niece Matidia.

There are some things that are impossible to do properly, like cannae or leuctra style tactics. This is because the depth of a formation doesn\\'t really add \"weight\" to the push.\\nTotal War games aren\\'t very historically realistic for quite a few reasons, usually related to gameplay. \\n Skirmishing is downplayed in the games, mainly because soldiers cover ground very quickly and don\\'t tire too much from running. This is sort of alleviated by the amount of damage the skirmishers inflict once battle is joined. \\n Morale is actually too  high  in the games. Most battles were decided by shattering morale, not grinding down the opposing army. For instance and Leuctra, once the spartan flank was overrun, the rest of the army fled quickly, as they knew they would be encircled. The examples of extreme casualties usually come from running down broken enemies. Another instance would be Cannae, where Hannibal completely encircled the Romans and spent hours hacking through panicked and broken men. This is for gameplay reasons, players understandably feel like crap when their huge doom army runs off the field with 1/2 of the men alive. \\n People die way too quickly in the games. Soldiers were mostly concerned with not dying (this ties into the running away thing from earlier). Soldiers likely wouldn\\'t be recklessly throwing themselves into the teeth of a phalanx, even the legions gave ground in front of them until they could break up the formation. This is probably mainly due to gameplay reasons, they don\\'t want battles taking hours. \\n There are other things like unit recruitment/overland map that are completely \"fictional\" for the purpose of gameplay as well. Also having direct control over the entire army and being able to switch tactics at any given time is fictional, but arguably necessary for the game. \\n A lot of these limits are imposed by the small scale of the battlefield as well. When you only have ~5 thousand man armies flanking maneuvers take seconds rather than minutes. You don\\'t really have enough men to form multiple lines/reinforcements. You are forced to pick between relatively weak skirmishers and heavy infantry because of unit caps. \\n TL;DR  Basically the game tries to give you historical options like flanking and ambushes, but due to technical limitations and gameplay concerns, they aren\\'t particularly accurate in any sense. \\n',\n  0),\n ('What Britain really was trying to balance was everybody else so they could continue to expand their empire. This was kind of toning down by the turn of the century and would only really return when the French and British started dividing up the German and Ottoman empires in Africa and the Middle East.

I mean, it's hard to say (which is why we don't allow these questions in the first place), but it just doesn't quite fit.  There wasn't a long-standing military establishment in Israel--in the early years, the military was essentially illegal militias under a new name.  Moreover, this situation meant that the political leadership had directed the paramilitaries in the pre-state era, so the political and military establishments weren't separate enough for one to fight the other.  Not only that, but the military was formed largely out of the Haganah, which was the armed wing of the faction that held political power in Israel after the elections, so there was little reason for the military to object to the political leadership. \\n The biggest test of this would've been when Israel accepted the reparations agreement from West Germany, which led to massive protests and rioting, which included Menachem Begin (sort of) calling for a coup.  But the military still defended parliament against the rioters.  And why shouldn't they have?  The old-guard of sorts was from the military of the political party that was currently in power.  The right wing's old militia was dismantled.  The military didn't have the political independence to make military rule a possibility. \\n You could also ask about the risk of becoming a one-party state.  After all, Labor was the dominant party for 30 straight years (first as Mapai, then as Alignment).  But the Israeli political system made that impractical, too.  Even though Labor was firmly in control of parliament, they weren't able to go it alone--except for a few months as the result of a party merger, Labor never held a majority of seats--they generally had around 45 seats of 120.  The government was in constantly in coalition with other parties.  And these coalitions were not composed of just a few parties, but a broad array of parties, representing diverse groups.  The first knesset, for instance, had a government formed by Labor in coalition with a religious party, a Middle Eastern Jewry party, an Arab party, and another left-wing party.  Any attempt at a policy to put Labor in a more powerful position could've easily alienated one of the other parties, causing the government to collapse and new elections called. \\n tl;dr the origin of Israel's military, being the armed wing of the political group in power, meant that the military would have little reason to take power.  the political system ensured that the dominant political party couldn't make things a one-party state \\n\",\n  0),\n ('From a Kansas perspective: The name Arkansas derives from the same root as the name for the state of Kansas.

For Catholics, a sacrament is valid (empowered and giving of grace) by the form of the act, usually the words spoken, the material objects used, and the persons involved.

There are other parts of the ritual (if you\\'ve ever been to an infant\\'s ceremony or an Easter vigil, there\\'s lots of robes and other prayers and anointing with oils), but these are just accidental to the actual  rite , which is how grace is conferred.

The Anglicans also claim this succession, because their Bishops broke away with Henry, and even outside of communion with Rome their office is still valid. Benedict XVI instituted the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of St. Peter about  a year ago, which allows Anglican priest and congregations to move back into communion with Rome and join the Church again. My pastor is actually one of these priests, he is happily married. \\n There are apparently Lutheran denominations which claim succession, but the Latin church doesn\\'t recognize them (although the Anglican does). It\\'s certainly possible, and the proper understanding of the sacrament is not necessary for it to be valid (so, for example, a Lutheran pastor who by chance had been ordained by a bishop in succession could administer a valid Eucharist, even though the Lutheran understanding differs from the Catholic in important ways.

And Mormon\\'s have a questionable claim to even being authentically Christian, so almost definitely not. \\n TL;DR: It depends, there could be Protestants ordained in the Catholic understanding, but there\\'s really no way to know, so Rome doesn\\'t explicitly recognize them.

The actual process of digging a site varies from region to region and director to director. But ultimately it involves digging square units into the site, stopping at arbitrary depths, recording every little detail (soil colour, consistency, slope, etc.) And putting all the dirt moved through a sieve (though we call it a screen). Artefacts are then recovered from the screen and sorted, labelled, drawn. \\n CRM is a bit different. Here, we do these things to make money. Basically the government (both Canada and the US) has laws in place that require archaeological assessment on any kind of proposed major construction. So archaeology companies are contracted out to perform those assessments. Each assessment can have 4 stages \\n 1 Is an initial background research of the area in question.

Most pirates were former sailors of some kind before becoming pirates (in fact the majority of pirates found their way into piracy by encountering them during a pirate boarding a merchant and deciding to become a pirate there). Some years, piracy was terrible, to the point that practically no ships were moving in and out of port when they normally would. It also doesn\\'t help when pirates sit outside of ports or significant choke points on trade routes and wait for merchants (Charleston, the Virginia capes, and the mouth of the Delaware river all suffered this a few times).

Pirates were going after the merchants, since besides essentials like supplies (food, drink, ammunition, repair items), they also had cargo that could be sold illegally to colonial merchants. Besides the profitability, merchants would be easier to take on that Navy ships. While a number of pirate crews looked to get \"ships of force,\" Navy ships were actually equipped and manned to fight - and pirates wanted to minimize risk to their operations and their lives (so the pirates often tried to avoid Navy ships). 4 easy to reference encounters between pirates and Navy men resulted in either death or defeat for the pirates. Blackbeard and Bartholomew Roberts were both killed in combat against Navy men, and Stede Bonnet and Samuel Bellamy both tried and gave up after casualties (in Stede Bonnet\\'s case, severe casualties which included being wounded himself). \\n Does that answer your question? I guess the simplest way to answer it (or the TL;DR) is: In times when pirates were really active, merchants had a much higher chance of encountering pirates since pirates would seek them out as valuable and easier targets (and knew where the merchants would more than likely show up at sea since pirates were mostly former sailors). \\nMuch of my information presented here (and a good book if you want to learn more about pirate strategy and tactics) is Benerson Little\\'s  Sea Rover\\'s Practice . \\n',\n  0),\n (\"Posted this before but I'll put it in here again for reference, although it's much along the same lines as /u/splendourfalls \\n It's barely taught in the UK, there's just no room for it in the curriculum. Instead our modern curriculum tends to focus on an uber fast blast through Greece, Rome, Anglo-Saxons, Norman Conquest, some Medieval England, Tudors and then Victorian Britain (usually through social history) then the briefest of mentions of the World Wars.\\nAlongside this is world history, which tends to be picked for political reasons. For instance I did Nazi Germany, American Civil Rights, Arab-Israeli Conflict and Apartheid South Africa. At GCSE level (14-16) the schools will have flexibility in what they teach from a selection of modules as /u/splendourfalls mentioned but they usually tend to pick subjects that have political impact such as the Middle East, Gender politics, Nazi Germany or a race related issue such as Apartheid South Africa or the Slave trade. The debate over whether we should be using history in this way or teaching the history of Britain is one that has gone on for a long time. For instance the British Empire barely features aside from in passing, which annoys a number of people from Conservative backgrounds. \\n Once you get out of school and hit Sixth Form/College it opens up a little and there's more chance of in depth study. For instance I did Britain 1815-1914 and Russia 1815-1990. Most schools at this level will have a choice between 8-10 subjects at this level and it's entirely down to the school what is taught. These subjects change every few years, I've seen the American Revolution in one prospectus but it's not a common thing and it's definitely not an emphasised thing. Most people who have been lucky enough to get taught the subject before Uni will have got it at this stage. \\n Finally it's at University level where you'll find the Revolution taught properly although again it's spotty depending at what university you're at and often it forms a small part of a generalised American history course. During my 16 years of education, it took me until the final year of my undergraduate degree to do the Revolution and then it was because I picked NYC during the Revolution as my dissertation topic. However I knew people who took Early America based courses, which included the Revolution. \\n If you're actually lucky enough to learn it then it's taught in a fairly balanced way from what I've been told, not the exaggerated way it is in America sometimes. Reasons for the Revolution are discussed both pro and contra, the state of the colonies are discussed, as are the Loyalists (who are as I understand it rather missing from the American story). The actual war is taught how it happened. The British won most of the battles, quickly adapted to the situation, contrary to the idea of bumbling redcoats being shot by snipers with rifles, but couldn't win the war because of the sheer scope of what they had to occupy, the politics at home and spotty Loyalist support. \\n tl;dr: It's not really taught, if you're lucky you might get it at 16-18 level. It's taught to a greater degree at undergraduate level but again it's at the whim of who happens to be teaching at your institution. The actual teaching is fairly balanced with no overt British exaggeration while dispelling much of the American myths of the conflict. It hasn't been considered important by our previous governments, although the current education secretary (Michael Gove) seems to be more interested in it and more 'traditional' topics that past ones. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"You might be right about the primary sources.

The purges were generally arbitrary, and almost entirely a function of Stalin\\'s paranoid, capricious personality and political infighting at \\n Both Yagoda and Yezhov are likely to have felt indispensable in their times. So too would many others who were purged, but that sense of being untouchable would likely have been much greater for the People\\'s Commissar for Internal Affairs (the head of the NKVD), responsible for actually carrying out the purges. \\n Yagoda, as NKVD chief at the start of the purges, was naive in at least one respect: it doesn\\'t appear that he appreciated quite how wide Stalin and his allies wanted to cast the net in search of \\'Trotskyists\\' and \\'Zinovievites\\', or that he displayed enough zeal in his search for enemies of the people. The telegram from Stalin to the Politburo on 25 September 1936, ordering Yagoda\\'s dismissal as People\\'s Commissar, says that much (emphasis mine): \\n > We deem it absolutely necessary and urgent that Comrade Yezhov be nominated to the post of People\\'s Commissar for Internal Affairs.  Yagoda had definitely proved himself to be incapable of unmasking the Trotskyite-Zinovievite bloc. The OGPU [the predecessor agency to the NKVD] is four years behind in this matter.  This is noted by all Party workers and by the majority of the representatives of the NKVD. \\n Robert Conquest\\'s parsing of the telegram and the decision to replace Pagoda in *[The Great Terror: A Reassessment]( seems to hit the nail on the head: \\n > No one, of course, thought for a moment that Yagoda\\'s removal indicated mere \"incapability.\" It was at once noted in the Party that \"it was not a question of dissatisfaction with his insufficiently active work ... this indicated political\\ndistrust of him.\" \\n Christopher Andrew says much the same thing in his second history of the KGB, *[The Sword and the Shield]( arguing that Yagoda \"was far less obsessed by Trotsky than Stalin was. Stalin\\'s chief grudge against him was probably a growing conviction that [Yagoda] had been deliberately negligent in his hunt for Trotskyist traitors.\" \\n But the question remains: could Yagoda have foreseen that Stalin wanted the kind of tempo and breadth in the purges that occurred after his arrest? I\\'d argue that it\\'s difficult to believe he could have. \\n In any case, the reins passed to Yezhov — who was appointed specifically because he was a loyal Stalinist and deemed more likely to carry out the purifying crusade Stalin believed the party needed. Yezhov personally engineered Yagoda\\'s eventual arrest, trial and execution a year or so after his dismissal, and  Yezhovschina  (the most wide-ranging and damaging period of the purges) began. \\n Yezhov\\'s own downfall in 1938 was equally predictable  with hindsight  — not least because he was the public face of the purges. Per Conquest again: \\n > Not that everyone blamed Stalin. His skill in remaining in the background deceived even minds like Pasternak and Meyerhold. If men—albeit nonpolitical—of this caliber could feel so, it is clear that the idea must have been wide-spread. The fear and hatred of the population was concentrated on Yezhov, who was thus unconsciously making himself ready to be the scapegoat, the eponym of the \" Yezhovshchina.\" \\n Conquest and others also make the argument that Yezhov, like Yagoda, was in his last days seen as having failed to maintain the revolutionary momentum of the purges — that he did not organise more public trials, or a second set of military show-trials. But there\\'s also an argument made by some that he wielded power  too  widely and that Stalin came to believe that  Yezhovschina  had damaged the Soviet state. Those perceived failures opened the door to Yezhov\\'s political rivals — not least Beria, who had been appointed deputy chief of the NKVD and who held no small grudge against Yezhov — to begin manoeuvring against him. \\n Beria at least had some of the benefit of hindsight: he had watched the purges unfold, and had watched both of his immediate predecessors fall from power along much the same trajectory. I would, however, point you to /u/Smilin_Dave\\'s answer, because he\\'s totally right that the case for Stalin having been poisoned is far from conclusive — not to mention the fact that Beria had powerful enemies in the Presidium, who were waiting in the wings after Stalin\\'s death. In the event, even his alliance with post-Stalin premier Malenkov didn\\'t prevent him from being executed in December 1953. \\n The tl;dr here is that it\\'s a particularly difficult topic to speculate about, because Stalin was no kind of rational actor and the internal politics of the Soviet political/security establishments were incredibly complicated. My take is that both men used the NKVD to settle their own scores, as well as to pursue actual or perceived enemies of the state — and that both would have hoped they were untouchable right up until the moment Stalin began moving against them. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"This is a hard question to answer especially following the rules of the subreddit because Pompey didn't leave any writing that survives (and as far as I know he didn't write anything), so I don't think there can be any secure means of gaining access to his thoughts. \\n The first thing to mention is Pompey expected to live.  There were still armies loyal to Pompey in Africa and Spain, and in fact Caesar almost died at Munda in Spain, so the war was by no means over.  Pompey's son, Sextus, had control of Sicily well into the 30s, and Augustus eventually had to take him out.  When Pompey got off the boat in Alexandria I bet he was as shocked as anyone else to find his head cut off. \\n TL:DR there were three more years of war and Pompey fleeing could have been a strategic retreat.  There were also other politicians around whom opposition to Caesar could concentrate and they came damn close to winning.  Who knows?  If Pompey wasn't assassinated, maybe he could have won? \\n\",\n  0),\n ('Well, a number of reasons. Perhaps the most notable, besides the loss/tie difference that you pointed to, is that they were sold as similar wars but were in fact very different. Korea, while unpopular, was nowhere near as catastrophic from a PR point of view as Vietnam.  South Korea was a legitimate state, and as such it made sense and was more understandable for the US to intervene on behalf of an endangered ally. The situation in Vietnam was totally different.  (Sorry about that, I don\\'t have the sources with me to back that up, so I\\'ll retract it, and I don\\'t know enough about South Korea to answer off the top of my head. My reasoning was based on Diem\\'s ultimately dying in a coup during the war, while See stayed in power afterwards, so I guess stability would be my one word answer.) It seems, at first, exactly like you described, \"to protect democratic factions in the country against Communist ones,\" or protect the South from the North like in Korea. That\\'s the one sentence, official answer, and the one that you\\'re most likely to get from any simple history of the subject. However, the situation in Vietnam was totally different from that sort of ideal. In reality, there was no democratic South Vietnam. It was established after the Geneva Conference of 1954 (which followed Vietnam\\'s war of independence from France) as a temporary state in preparation for national elections in 1956. \\n Ho Chi Minh, the leader of North Vietnam, was extremely popular, representing both nationalism and successful resistance to a much more powerful foreign occupier, which is something of a recurring theme in Vietnamese history. He was a brutal autocrat, to be sure, frequently killing political opponents, by the thousands if need be. That said, he was not the agent of some larger Communist conspiracy. He played the Soviets for military support during both wars, but did not answer to them, and was a revolutionary nationalist who happened to be Communist rather than a revolutionary Communist seeking to cause the fall of Southeast Asia. \\n In the leadup to 1956, it was clear that Ho was going to sweep the elections. He was much more popular than his Southern counterpart, Ngo Dinh Diem, who was also autocratic and led an extremely corrupt South Vietnamese (SVN) government, without popular support. By all accounts, South Vietnam should have ended in 1956, with the country unifying after Ho\\'s inevitable victory in the national elections. However, Diep did not partake in the elections, ensuring the prolongation of the SVN state, which thereafter existed almost solely because of US aid. \\n The question of whether the US should have intervened is an extremely loaded one, but it boils down to a set of assumptions that policy makers had. First, those in charge assumed that Ho was part of a larger Communist plot and that he thus had to be stopped to halt Soviet expansion. Now, the theory of monolithic Communism, which was also key to the domino theory of one country\\'s fall engendering a worldwide collapse of free societies into Communist control, was demonstrably false (Here, I was pointing mainly to Tito being independent and the emergent Sino-Soviet split, which while it was later than the earliest military advisers, still was a political reality at during escalation), and many policymakers knew that. There was no real international agenda, and different countries, whether the USSR, China, Yugoslavia, or Vietnam, had their own take on how to govern and their own priorities. \\n Second, policymakers assumed that SVN was a viable, independent and preexisting state, which was untrue. It was corrupt, lacked popular support, and should by all rights have disappeared after the 1956 elections. The continued to funnel money and supplies into the government long after they knew that none of it was being put to good use (this appears in both Appy and the Pentagon Papers. Appy says that SVN citizens were well aware of and hated the governmental corruption, and specifically that \"Diem\\'s popular support was thin, his military largely inept, his government riddled with corruption.\" The Pentagon papers also fully acknowledge Diem\\'s unpopularity and inefficiency). \\n Lastly, Americans assumed that the Vietnam situation would affect their place in international politics as a whole. The whole doctrine of \"credibility\" led policymakers to think that a fall of SVN to Communism would lead the USSR and the world in general to lose respect and fear for the US, which singlehandedly explains why the war dragged on as long as it did. No one wanted to be the first American president to lose a war, and so they supported the stalemate in the hopes of kicking the can further down the road. \\n Now, to fully answer your question, basically the war was fought on false premises  AND  the American public found out about it. Journalists became more critical of American presence as they found out more about the situation. In addition, the publication of the Pentagon Papers, a collection of classified documents concerning American involvement in Vietnam, turned more Americans against the war, and led to an increasingly popular sentiment that this war was being fought for thoroughly wrong reasons, was costing thousands of American lives, was being fought wrong, and that Americans had no real stake in the outcome. Combine all that, and you get the least popular conflict in American history. However, this history is being forgotten at an alarming rate, with  support for the Vietnam War increasing  the number of Americans who think intervention was a mistake decreasing later and later after the war\\'s end (this was a statistic that I saw, must have simply misremembered it, thanks). \\n Now, I\\'m only a college student, and so this likely isn\\'t a perfect answer. I would like to keep contributing to this sub, so feedback is welcome and appreciated. \\n In terms of sources, this is primarily in James Patterson\\'s  Grand Expectations, The United States: 1945-1975  which is a solid general history of recent America, and Christian Appy\\'s  Patriots: The Vietnam War Remembered from All Sides  which is a fascinating collection of firsthand accounts from people involved with the war, which I cannot recommend highly enough. If you\\'re interested, I would also look into the Pentagon Papers themselves, which, once you\\'re more acquainted with the history behind them, provide a fascinating insight into what happened, and what went wrong. \\n TL;DR:  War fought for wrong reasons, Americans find out about it. \\n EDIT:  Sweet Jesus this blew up, some great comments below, so listen to those smarter people first. I\\'ll try to fix what I can, though there is some stuff that I don\\'t have answers for. \\n',\n  0),\n ('(warning, ridiculous wall of text, so sorry) \\n I think the difference in outcome can be attributed to a number of factors, but chiefly: \\n A.  American war goals in Vietnam were substantively different from our war goals in Korea. \\n B.   American use of military force in Vietnam was guided by incorrect assumptions about Vietnam\\'s history, culture, and leaders. \\n C.  American leadership incorrectly applied the lessons of history, as they saw them, to the novel situation in Vietnam. \\n (I recommend reading \"Dereliction of Duty,\"- a history of the lead-up to the Vietnam Conflict in the Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson administrations written by a DoD historian with access to their archives. This is where I got most of my analysis.) \\n A. The primary difference between the conflict in Vietnam and the conflict in Korea is this: \\n In Korea, we sought a military victory to achieve our political goals. \\n In Vietnam, we sought a military stalemate to achieve our political goals. \\n In Korea, military force was used to achieve territorial integrity and political independence for South Korea. In Vietnam, military force was intended to force Ho Chi Minh and the North Vietnamese to the negotiating table. We didn\\'t want to stay in Vietnam forever, and we weren\\'t prepared to do so. The idea was, we\\'ll bomb \\'em, and kill a lot of \\'em, and the losses in personnel and materiel would induce the Communists to give up their plans for a united Vietnam. \\n B. This was doomed to fail, given Vietnam\\'s historical context. \\n We vastly overestimated the efficacy of airpower and underestimated the resilience and determination of the Vietnamese. American policymakers saw the conflict by their own lights, judging the conflict as a battle between competing ideologies. But Vietnamese civilians saw little difference between American \"support,\" for South Vietnam and French colonial domination of Indochina. The Vietnamese tradition of independence was not properly understood, to America\\'s great disadvantage. \\n Moreover, American military policy in Vietnam was fundamentally incoherent. \\n During the Kennedy and Johnson administrations the leading voice in Vietnam policy was Robert McNamera. McNamera was a technocrat and approached problems from an engineer\\'s subject position. He was eager for data and presented his arguments as syllogisms supported with facts. Crucial to his philosophy of warfighting was his presumption that all actors were \"rational,\" on his own terms. \\n McNamera believed (and expressed often) that military force could be used to \"communicate\" with the North Vietnamese, the Soviets, and the Chinese. We would signal our desire to drive the NVN to stop their attempts at national unification by increasing our pressure and changing our targets. \\n Bombings were ordered initially as retaliations for NVN attacks on American personnel in SVN. Rather than committing to a buildup of forces and a sustained ground campaign from the start, we sought to fight this war with a minimum commitment in cost and lives. This meant slowly intensifying bombing campaigns and troop deployments. This in turn allowed the North Vietnamese time to adapt, counter our efforts and it ensured they retained the initiative at all times. \\n Rather than \"communicating,\" the North Vietnamese were fighting what they saw as a war of liberation against just one of many foreign colonial empires they had tangled with in their history. \\n McNamera\\'s force of personality persuaded the majority of the administrations of Kennedy and Johnson to follow his lead and embrace his view of the conflict. Those who disagreed with him were marginalized through bureaucratic maneuvering and, sometimes, outright lies. McNamera\\'s mistaken premise was assuming his enemy was like him, and wanted what he wanted: less blood and treasure spent in war. The North Vietnamese were willing to be lavish with blood (and were poor already) in order to achieve the intangible, ideological goal of independence. \\n C. McNamera and American presidents compared the Vietnamese conflict with previous historical events, but these events were inapplicable to the novel situation in Vietnam. \\n The most employed analogy (it remains employed to this day) was the comparison between Neville Chamberlain\\'s \"capitulation\" to Hitler at Munich and the possibility of withdrawal from South Vietnam. Americans believed that, had the British stood up to Hitler and prevented him from annexing the Sudetenland at Munich, then his aggression would\\'ve been checked, possibly preventing World War Two.  The lesson here is: if you want to prevent war, stand up to aggression. \\n But here\\'s a competing analogy no one at the time seemed to employ: in order to check Japanese aggression in the Pacific, FDR initiated an oil embargo (among other materials) against the Japanese Empire. This in turn forced the Japanese to seek out fresh sources of supply for their armies. This in turn led to their surprise attack on Allied holdings in the Pacific. \\n So what\\'s the lesson here?  Sometimes when you stand up to aggression, you end up going to war. \\n Another analogy employed by McNamera and others was the Cuban Missile Crisis. There, military force WAS employed successfully to communicate policy goals to the Soviet Union. However, the situation was materially different from Vietnam in many ways. Cuba wasn\\'t a military conflict per se, despite the Bay of Pigs. Cuba was firmly within the American sphere of influence and Soviet missiles there appeared to be an existential threat to American security. Finally, we were communicating, ultimately, with the Soviets- another great power interested in opposite but comparable policy goals. None of these were true in Vietnam. \\n tl;dr: \\n America didn\\'t seek to win the Vietnam War. It wanted to end it by stalemate. \\n America misunderstood Vietnamese war goals and historical contexts. \\n America misapplied the lessons of history to a situation entirely dissimilar from the one they faced. \\n (hey, again, sorry. if you made it down this far, gee, thanks!) \\n',\n  0),\n (\"Wilmer McClean owned a farm near Manassas, VA.

I\\'m seeing a few problems I\\'d like to point out in this thread. \\n First of all, the only cited source I\\'ve seen here is a book entitled  Late Victorian Holocausts . If that title doesn\\'t suggest serious bias then I don\\'t know what does. If we want to play the single-slanted-source game, I\\'ll just go dig up my copy of Niall Ferguson\\'s  Empire  and then talk about how Britain was a fantastic colonial power just trying to do right by the poor, poor Indians. But that\\'s not good historical research, so we have to exclude that, or at least balance it with an opposing viewpoint. \\n Second, OP\\'s description of Churchill makes him out to be a bigoted, uncaring imperialist. Maybe that holds some water, but I happen to know for a fact that Churchill cared a fair bit about the Indian people, even if he didn\\'t always show it. Fantastic examples of this stand out from the page in the debates on Indian independence following the war - you know those arguments about how Britain didn\\'t want to let go because India was a part of the Empire and, well, \"Father knows best\". That\\'s not it at all. In the 1940s nobody was really sure what decolonization would look like, and they primarily feared chaos or mass-murder, most importantly in the case of India and its racial tensions. On March 6, 1947 Churchill made a speech to the House of Commons that, I kid you not, revolved around the idea that \"Britain has a duty to stay a little longer in order to facilitate orderly transition to a native, Commonwealth government and to  prevent the Hindus and Muslims from killing each other \".* This is, of course, a single example, but Churchill isn\\'t somebody I would generally characterize as an \"Indian hater\". \\n Out of curiosity, what is the full text of these remarks that Churchill allegedly made? \\n Now, about the famine itself. A lot of the blame for the famine itself has been placed on the trade barriers erected by the provinces of India which prevented food from being shipped to Bengal to alleviate the hunger. A couple of important notes here: \\n 1) The bad harvests of 1941-1943 were a nationwide thing - that is to say, all of India was affected. The reason the famine was particularly bad in 1943 was because the fall of Burma to Japanese forces took away Bengal\\'s main source of food. The difference that the rest of India could have made was significantly reduced by their own shortages.\\n2) The trade barriers that prevented even small quantities of grain and other foodstuffs from being shipped were erected by the Indian Provincial Governments - made up of Indians belonging to the Indian National Congress. The Government of India Act (the 1935 one, not the 1947 one) had basically gutted the British of their ability to do anything, delegating that instead to the aforementioned Provincial assemblies and an Indian Congress. When the British India Office tried to tear down the trade barriers in 1943 they were blocked by the Provincials - by Indians attempting to keep their own provinces from starving. \\n So Bengal is now in a tight situation: trapped between the Japanese to the east and their unhelpful fellow provinces in the west, food would have had to be shipped in from other locations to alleviate the famine. Most of Asia was under Japanese occupation, the Soviets were having a hell of a time just keeping their own people fed (not to mention that the shipping time overland from Siberia to Bengal would have rotted the food anyway), the rest of India wasn\\'t pitching in, the Middle East wasn\\'t going to be much help (come on, now), Europe was under Germany\\'s thumb, etc, etc. So that leaves a few places: North America, South America, Australia, and South Africa. \\n North America : shipping lanes across the Pacific under constant threat by that little detail of the Japanese Navy. Shipments would have had to be sent down past Australia first, negating the purpose and probably taking too long to keep the food edible.\\n South America : same deal. The U-Boat threat was also at its height in 1942-1943, making the Atlantic crossing extremely hazardous, if less so in the South Atlantic. But one has to remember that Britain had no direct influence over South America, and it sure as hell didn\\'t have any money to send at that time.\\n Australia : Remember that Japanese naval threat we just talked about? Yeah, the Japanese had just crushed Burma, meaning that they were at best a little more than 100 kms from Calcutta, the main port of Bengal. By the time the threat had been negated most of the damage had already been done. \\n tl;dr: Maybe, but Japanese conquests and Indian protectionism between provinces certainly didn\\'t help. Also, quit it with the Churchill bashing - I know it\\'s fashionable but it makes you sound bigoted and a touch intractable unless you can produce some solid, dated quotes. \\n *The summary is in my own words. \\n Sources: I\\'m writing a damn dissertation on the subject of British India post-1942 right now. But if you must know, my sources include transcriptions of Churchill\\'s speeches in Parliament, a bunch of historical literature on the decline of the British Empire written in the 1980s (these should be taken with a grain of salt, a big fashion at the time was to bash Thatcher and by extension most of the Tories\\' policies for the last half-century), and a lot of other compilations of letters from Indian leaders at the time and British governmental personnel on the ground in India. \\n',\n  0),\n ('I agree that the question is based on a false premise, though I think I may disagree with LBo87\\'s characterization. \\n The competition between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. was  fundamentally  military and existential (I believe that there are a number of people who disagree, but I believe the facts ultimately support my position). \\n The preferred goal of the U.S.S.R. was the replacement of the U.S. government and society with a more like-minded one (i.e., socialist dictatorship), and one militarily subservient to the Soviets as well. They did this to other countries in eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Africa. The goal of the U.S. was approximately the same (one could argue that it sprung from a human-rights and self-defense perspective). My impression is that even the most detente-oriented U.S. leaders would have taken the opportunity to change the Soviet government if it could be done bloodlessly and risklessly. \\n With this established, the question is only by what means does one accomplish the goal (converting as many other countries, and possibly the main opponent, to your preferred system of government)? As pointed out by other commenters, the Space Race was one method to gain prestige. This was a means to the end of getting other nations into one\\'s own \"camp\" (by attempting to demonstrate the superiority of one\\'s own system). \\n Another method, however, is use of force, threat of force, and offers of protection.

A give third nation isn\\'t going to \"covert to\" or \"stay in\" your camp if your opponent has the means to overthrow the government by force (either by sponsoring a revolution or direct invasion) or can credibly threaten to. \\n So the Space Race wasn\\'t a \"better\" method of competition because it couldn\\'t replace the military component. A more ambiguous question is why the intensity didn\\'t keep up on the U.S. side (accepting the premise that the Space Race was a component of the overall competition). This, I have no expertise in. However, I speculate that it\\'s some combination of: a) cost-effectiveness (whether there were ultimate, tangible prestige \"gains\"), b) a perceived \"win\" given the Moon landings (and thus dimishing returns to further money spent), c) the premise is false, in that the U.S. focused on the space shuttle and satellites instead of space stations, but didn\\'t actually \"back off\" in the race. \\n TL;DR: The choice presented is false.

A third is the criticism of \"agency\" as a device which posits humans-vs-humans, instead of against the structuration of larger world-historical processes such as capitalism (I\\'ll bracket a mention of the enduring subfield of the history of capitalism, which has shifted toward financial instruments in the last decade, concurrent with recent global financial crises). \\n Does this make sense?

Walter Johnson’s  River of Dark Dreams  (2013) is a series of evocative portraits of the the global cotton market and its material origins on the Mississippi River in the Antebellum period. Johnson argues that it is crucial to look not at the “agency” of slaves but at their experience and consciousness as a whole, and how the world is structured around them; he thus focuses on material processes (production, exchange, consumption) on micro and macro scales and cognitive experience (how the world was structured for masters, slaves, and everyone in between), and insists the material and cognitive are interlinked. In this way, race can be seen in Johnson’s work as a material and cognitive reality that is understood by blacks and whites alike; Johnson brings out historical racial consciousness by exploring, for instance, the ways that certain sounds (dogs barking, horses hooves clopping) or the bounded spaces of the plantation had different meanings for blacks and whites, while also tracing out the bales of slave-picked cotton that entered global markets and fostered increase demand for such commodities. There\\'s more to the book, and I\\'d love to hear from people who\\'ve read it, but I\\'ll stop the example there. I put it forward as an example of a work that uses \"scaling,\" that depicts \"infrastructure\", and which resists the \"agency\" thesis. Johnson only acknowledges the last point directly, the rest is embedded in the narrative. Anyone read any works that operate along similar lines? \\n To make a connection to more widely-read work -- \"Scaling\" has been aptly shown by work by Sven Beckert (\"World Wide Web of Cotton Production\"), who shows the effects of the Civil War on world cotton consumption and production markets. Another recent work by Richard White,  Railroaded , deploys the element of scaling quite well, though his former work on the Columbia River does too. And its worth mentioning the classic  Nature\\'s Metropolis  by William Cronon.  Indeed, it seems like some work in environmental history has a good grasp on what I\\'ve called scaling. \\n TLDR: \\n \\n Does the \"scaling\" metaphor work for people? Do they see it in different subfields than 19th century US history? \\n \\n Is infrastructure an important component that allows these to operate? How are historians addressing issues of \"infrastructure\" and \"environment\", in your experience? \\n \\n Is \"agency\" still an analytical category used in your fields? When is it most useful? Less useful? \\n \\n \\n',\n  0),\n ('There was never a singular effort to build a \"religions pentagon\" to serve as the center of a massive religion.  You\\'re asking about both Catholic & Orthodox religions which are two halves of the Chalcedonian Christian church separated by schism in 1054.  Currently the Roman & Latin churches view the Holy See of Rome (called the Vatican) as the highest authority for their religion.  The Eastern Orthodoxy views the Holy See of Constantinople (now Istanbul) as the highest authority for their church.  This evolved over many centuries from the precept that there are five elevated Apostolic See\\'s formed by the the apostles of Jesus. \\n When the Roman Empire adopted Christianity there was a melding of ecclesiastical governance (territorial administration of the private church) with temporal governance (roman territorial government structure) which elevated five churches to be lead by Patriarchs. \\n There are additional Sees which have historical claim to foundation by an apostle but they did not receive imperial investiture.  The denominations, orders, sects, etc related to each of these early churches were either extinguished or adopted into the early branches of the christian church. \\n These elevated territories were: \\n \\n Alexandria in Egypt founded by St. Mark. \\n Antioch in ancient Syria by St. Peter. \\n Constantinople in Greece founded by St. Andrew \\n Jerusalem in ancient Judea by St. Peter & St. James \\n Rome in Italy by St. Peter & St. Paul \\n \\n These were now the Patriarchy of the Roman (Imperial) Church and there role in governance of adherents & there subsequent affect on temporal politics evolved over time.  Previously local churches followed the idea of a single faith without an actual \"rules book.\"  A particular church may have followed the guidance of Metropolitans (think Prince-Bishops or Arch-Bishops) who were the bishops of populated areas with large congregations and greater church authority.  After the Pentarchy was formed an idea of a regional headquarters of faith formed which lead to a coalesecing of ideas. \\n There were a multitude of competing Christian religions for hundreds of years.  The scope of which is excessive and difficult to summarize so we can jump ahead to efforts to condense the branches into an orthodoxy first with the Council of Ephesus in 431. \\n A consensus by majority was reached at Ephesus but still resulted in the breakaway Assyrian Church.  The Council of Chalcedon in 451 further condensed the church into the modern branches you recognize today.  It too had a major breakaway with the Miaphysite (Oriental Orthodoxy) Church separating from the new orthodox. \\n The Great Schism did not happen until the 11th century and was a culmination of many factors.  Primary the loss of 3 of the Pentarchy when Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem were lost of Muslim rule lead to a \"two party\" system between Rome & Constantinople. \\n Significant differences in policy were directly related to temporal politics.  The Western Roman Empire collapsed while the Eastern Roman Empire thrived.  In the west the Patriarch of Rome (the Popes) were given greater temporal power as the city of Rome was all but abandoned the Italian peninsula fractured into a series of waring states, barbarian invasions and conquest by external forces.  In the east the Ecumenical Patriarchs were subject to the Byzantine Emperors and at times functioned as the defacto imperial administrators of all religious matters. \\n Another temporal factor that greatly contributed to the eventual schism was the Popes investiture of the Holy Roman Emperor.  In 799 Pope Leo III had been driven out of Rome and sought refuge in the court of Charlemagne.  They struck a deal where Charlemagne put Pope Leo III back in office by force (he used his army to escort him back to Rome) and the restored Pope \"surprised\" Charlemagne with the title \"Holy Roman Emperor and Protector of the Church.\"  This greatly aided Charlegmane as his rule-by-force lacked an appropriate multi-jurisdictional title sanctifying his conquest of western Europe.  This invented Roman authority of investiture was poorly received by the already existing (Eastern) Roman Emperors. \\n tl;dr There were over a dozen \"Holy Sees\" which trace there formation to the direct actions of an Apostle, including one in ancient India.  The Roman emperors made Christianity a state religion and elevated five of these Sees based on political expedience & the existing Roman provincial system of government.  Over time the Pentacrhy evolved and an order of presidence set the Roman See as the highest order & the Constantople as the second.  Three of the Sees were lost to Muslim conquest.  The balance of temporal power shifted and elevated the Constantinople See to \"equal authority with Rome.\"   The Roman See experienced unprecedented levels of freedom in the temporal realm, while the Constantinople See remained embedded by their liege the Eastern Roman Emperor.  Sweeping political change in western Europe benefited from a multinational political church entity and pressure on Rome resulted in significant changes in how the two halves of the church interacted with temporal government. \\n Many attempts over the centures by \"both halves\" to recapture Jerusalem (and the other Sees) were initially successful but ultimately failed. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Yes and no. It depends on the point in time you are asking about. \\n For quite a while the soviet space program was aimed at doing science while not costing too much. They got their funding due to the \"dual use\" nature of giant rockets, i.e. as ICBMs. But as the world started to notice, the political leadership quickly figured out the propaganda value of their nation\\'s success in space. The space program was expanded and moon landing was tentatively planned for the mid seventies. \\n Then American president Kennedy gave a speech about landing on the Moon before the en of the sixties. Now, the US hadn\\'t actually achieved all that much and their progress didn\\'t look quick enough to manage such a hugely complex feat. So the Soviets didn\\'t take this speech seriously. American politicians were known to promise lots of things without any intention of ever doing anything. \\n But what they didn\\'t know is that NASA had been working on a Moon landing for a while and Kennedy had been given a detailed presentation about the plan shortly before giving that famous speech. So a couple years later NASA suddenly starts launching the Saturn family of rockets several times a year. This came completely out of the blue, because NASA had been working on these rockets even way back when the Mercury and Gemini programs were just getting started. The US government also spend a huge portion of the federal budget on this. \\n So the soviet politicians became worried and ordered their space program to also land on the Moon within a few years. But that was practically impossible to achieve within such a tight budget and schedule. One of the biggest hurdles was that the SU did not produce a rocket motor that came even close to the F1 engine\\'s performance. The soviet philosophy had been to mass produce proven engines and to just cluster them together for more performance. Unfortunately the thrust necessary to launch even a tiny mission to the Moon (and back) necessitated a ridiculous number of engines, hence the N1 rocket. \\n The soviets actually made good progress on the N1. Western commentators often point to the frequent failures but that standard fare for the soviet rocket engineering process. They just flew it and examined the wreckage to find the areas they needed to improve. This system worked perfectly when you have hundreds of relatively cheap engines coming from assembly lines. It seems likely that the N1 could have been made to work reliably, had the budget or timetable allowed it. The other parts you need for a Moon landings were engineered as well, though they were only ever tested on unmanned flights. Because when they saw the Americans continuing to casually send people to the Moon for a couple of years, while their own rocket engineers only promised a lot but had not delivered yet, the soviet leadership killed the program and claimed they never targeted the Moon anyways. \\n TL;DR the soviets wanted to land on the Moon at some point but they didn\\'t think they were in a race until it was to late to do anything about it. \\n',\n  0),\n ('The discovery of gold was accidental, and even those who did realize that it  was  gold and that there was likely  more  gold nearby, really had no idea of the extraordinary amount of wealth that later would be panned out of the rivers. They didn\\'t understand what they had, and at first most were skeptical that it wasn\\'t just a fluke lucky discovery of a few bits of gold. \\n The news of gold in California was initially talked up and popularized by Sam Brannan who stood to make money by attracting people to his general store that he had just opened at Sutter\\'s Fort near where the gold was discovered. \\n >Fatefully, Brannan . . . guessed that as much money might be made from the miners as from the mines, and he opted for publicity. He purchased enough gold dust to fill a jar and traveled to San Francisco. . . . He paraded conspicuously about the town, waving his hat and shouting, \"Gold! Gold! Gold from the American River!\" The rumors had preceded him, but this material evidence made the rumors suddenly credible. . . . The small population of San Francisco nearly vanished overnight in the direction of Sutter\\'s mill. (H. W. Brands,  The Age of Gold: The California Gold Rush and the New American Dream,  New York: Anchor Books, 2002, p. 43.) \\n But gold was first discovered 4 months before Brannan ever went to San Francisco. Apparently the initial gold discoverers, James Marshall and John Sutter, were more concerned with getting their sawmill built than gold. They understood that they had found gold, but since laborers were so scarce, they tried to keep the news as private as possible because they were worried about losing their labor force to gold rumors. Keeping the discovery a complete secret ultimately proved impossible. (Apparently Sutter himself like to talk and he had a cook at Sutter\\'s Fort who couldn\\'t keep a secret either.) \\n Rumors, of course, spread, and some went to look for gold, but most Californians were initially skeptical that there was any truth in it. \\n >Even then the military governor was assured by a visitor to Monterey that the reports from the American River were untrue. \"A few fools have hurried to the place, but you may be sure there is nothing in it.\" And the editor of one of the two little newspapers published at San Francisco denounced the whole business as \"Superlatively silly,\" \"all sham, a supurb [sic] takein as was ever got up to guzzle the gullible.\" (Rodman Wilson Paul,  Mining Frontiers of the Far West, 1848-1880,  Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1963, rev. ed. 2001, p. 13.) \\n But by late May 1848, spurred by Brannan\\'s advertising with gold dust in hand, the entire towns were reportedly stripped of men as they all flocked to the American River to search for gold. And it just snowballed from there. \\n TL;DR:  Gold was accidentally discovered, and no one understood the magnitude of what they had found.

I\\'m not a prescriptivist when comes to language though, so I\\'ll just use both willy-nilly. \\n Some A-MAIZE-ing background (this is a required pun whenever discussing maize) \\n Just to build on your comment (because you\\'re basically right), the timing of the start of maize domestication is full of disputes, partly because the transition from its ancestral teosinte to full on maize was a gradual one. For reference on how far maize had to go to become \"maize,\" [here is picture of a teosinte seedpod on top a cob of corn]( The general idea is that teosinte domestication  began  not too long after wheat became properly domesticated, about 10K years or more before present. \\n The first agreed upon corn cobs, though, were found in Tehuacan in what is now Puebla and are dated around 3500 BC. Or maybe they are at  Guilá Naquitz in Oaxaca about 700 years earlier , you also know that this region around the Rio Balsas was a major gold producing region later on, making it pretty damn important in Mexican history. \\n Anyway, both the Tehuacan and Guilá Naquitz cobs are very primitive compared to modern day corn, to the point that both have been disputed as actually being maize. That argument is irrelevant here because -- regardless of when corn became corn -- intensive maize agriculture didn\\'t take off in Mexico for more than 1000 years after the Tehuacan cobs. \\n When maize did explode it joined a variety of already domesticated (and less problematic to domestic) crops like squash and beans to form what is known as the \"Three Sisters\" of Northern and Mesoamerican native agriculture. You may think tomatoes should be in there, but you would be wrong. Tomatoes are actually from South America and did not expand up North until later (still pre-Conquest though). The Mesoamericans did have early tomatilloes though, which are completely different genus ( Physalis  vs.  Solanum ). Once corn got proper domesticated and spread about, early civilizations took off, and the earliest complex Mesoamerican civilization, the Olmecs, emerged in what is now Veracruz. For any hydraulic theory of civilization buffs out there, it has been hypothesized that the rise and dominance of the Olmec civilization was a result of their ability to harness the rich and regularly flooded lowlands to grow more maize crops per season than elsewhere. \\n Down South \\n Implicit in the OP\\'s question is \"Why did S. America boom early and often, while N. America lagged?\" and it\\'s a fair question. To get to N. America, after all, maize only had to cross the dry regions of Northern Mexico (which were not as forbidding back then, for reasons that involve sheep). To get to S. America, maize either had to cross through the mountainous jungles of Central America and Northern South America, or take a boat down the coast. What is the truth? Well, grab your eye-patches and parrots you salty dogs, because there is one theory that maize reached coastal Ecuador even before the \"proper\" cobs of Tehaucan and Guilá Naquitz. Of course, there is a  counter-argument . \\n Either way, South Americans, as previously noted, had tomatoes and a variety of other domesticated crops like the potato and quinoa which could admirably fill the role of \"intensively cropped carbohydrate source.\" S. American also had the oldest complex civilization in the Americas, [Norte Chico]( which had no staple grain crop. The point I\\'m trying to make here is that South America had other resources to drawn on. \\n Head North to get Southwest \\n Historical links between the American SW and Mexico are pretty well established, though the contact doesn\\'t seem to have been direct. Regardless, the earliest corn kernels in the SW show up in Bat Cave in New Mexico and were dated just about the same time as the Tehuacan cobs, or even earlier! Naturally, [this has been challenged]( but the gist is that -- regardless of the timing of maize introduction -- corn agriculture doesn\\'t take hold of the SW until a few centuries after it spread in Mexico. Complex societies eventually follow, but there\\'s a whole bunch of confounding factors here. \\n NOW let\\'s go East \\n There\\'s a problem with the OP\\'s question, in that it posits N. America as a singular object, when in reality the continental US is bigger than West Africa, and I say this with the fully ironic knowledge that I much more often say that the latter is almost as large as the former. N. America is a big place with plenty of regions for crops and civilizations to spring up. Maize may have reached the Mesoamerican-linked SW, but it took centuries after that for it to spread to the Eastern woodlands (which already had several domesticated crops, but none packing the same cheap energy as maize). The thing to note here is that the riverine woodlands of Eastern North America, are much better suited to intensive agriculture than the more arid SW. \\n So, not long after maize gets a roothold across the Eastern US, we start seeing complex civilizations crop up (heh, \"crop up\") the most prominent of which was  Cahokia , I see the paucity of N. American civilizations more a fluke of the late timing in the introduction of a major cereal crop than anything else, but I may be overly ecologically reductionist in this. \\n Conclusion, because tl;dr is the mating call of the  Ignorantius redditii , an abominable species \\n Maize domestication started thousands of years after indigenous people in the Mid-East started selecting for more productive wheat, and domestication of teosinte didn\\'t even really start until einkorn and emmer wheat were basically already stable crops. From there it took a few thousand more years to make maize a productive crop capable of supporting large dense populations. Then it took even centuries more for it to diffuse from its native area. Also, [maize is damn complicated to process]( and I really want to dig up my old bioarchaeology text books to look into pre-Contact [pellagra]( This exceeding slow spread may seem unusual, but keep in mind that wheat also took its time spreading from it\\'s Fertile Crescent homeland and establishing itself in such far distant places like Egypt and Greece. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"Not a mistranslation so much as an over-translation. \\n In Yuan, China, there is a national park named after Gaoligongshan Mountain.

These religious reformers were also quite widely anti-monarchical in addition to being anti-Prelatical - both Laud and his king Charles I lost their heads as a result.  Note that as republican (at least at first) and puritan, this group was both religiously and politically progressive (and I mean this in the sense not that they were closer to modern values, but more in the sense that they saw themselves as working towards newer and better things rather than reinforcing older values). \\n Here\\'s where your question starts to get answered: When the Protectorate failed and the Monarchy was restored in 1660, quite a few punitive measures followed against those who sought to worship outside of the Church of England, and these weren\\'t lifted in any meaningful way until after the 1688 revolution, and for Catholics not until the 19th century (save for a few specific and complicated instances from 1685-88, which is getting off topic). \\n This punitive legislation (collectively called The Clarendon Code, The Test Act is also important here) can be interpreted as revenge against the groups that were seen by royalists as having torn the country asunder in the midcentury.  The party that would come to be known as the Whigs largely struggled against these punitive measures, partly for the relief of their allies in political ideology from earlier decades, but also because they saw them as being part and parcel to arbitrary monarchy.  Thus, from 1660 to 1688, religious freedom came to be associated with the party that was driven by a more modern notion of liberalist political philosophy, whereas their opponents, the Tories, were supporters of a stronger monarch who had a strong relationship with the episcopacy. \\n It deserves mention as well that for the Whigs, religious freedom was secondary to a constitutionalist government - in 1672 when Charles II attempted to suspend penalties against nonconformists via Royal decree, the Whigs blocked him, as that was a step towards arbitrary government and undermined Parliamentary power (they were fighting for toleration via act of Parliament - they also disliked that the toleration extended to Catholics). \\n The 1688 Revolution that piggybacked Protestant toleration into the English settlement eventually brought the Liberalist Whig party into significant power and resulted in a hands-off approach to religious legislation, with pretty much only the Test Act remaining.  While a government that requires that you swear a religious oath, essentially against Catholicism, to participate doesn\\'t seem \"Secular\" by modern standards, it established the necessary climate for religious pluralism to thrive, which has a logical progression into a government that just decides to stay the hell out of religious affairs. \\n Sorry if this is choppy. \\n tldr - starting in the 17th century religious pluralism became aligned with anti-Absolutist political progressivism and eventually this grew into secularism, at least in England \\n',\n  0),\n (\"They're also damn effective.

At the same time, transport was in short supply, and diverting these resources to civil needs was on the bottom of Berlin\\'s priority list. To \"solve\" both these problems, Berlin developed the ploy of declaring a threatened burgh to be a \"fortress city\". This meant that the civilian populace remained in place, while young and old were drafted into Volkssturm militia units. Berlin depended upon the fanaticism of these poorly equipped, untrained units, and it was believed that fanaticism would be greater if their friends and families were under immediate threat. \\n On the Soviet side, vicious propaganda against the German  people  had been employed since the early years of the war (in response to Nazi propaganda which portrayed Slavs as subhumans). Germans were depicted as a  race  of greedy warmongers, and it is this racial component of the conflict that gave the Red Army license to take its vengeance upon the German civilian population. Official Red Army policy encouraged its soldiers to loot and pillage, allotting each soldier a free 10 kg shipment home every month (to combat the problem of units being weighed down due to carrying their looted spoils with them). \\n In the last months of the war, the Red Army\\'s brutality became so widespread and vicious that it actually became counter-productive: German soldiers were no longer fighting for the Reich, but to buy desperate time for their friends and family to escape westward. Stalin was stunned by how easily the allies were advancing in the west, compared to the stiff resistance faced by the Red Army. Moscow finally ordered the propaganda to be toned down, and targeted against  Nazis  rather than all Germans. It was too little, and too late - even in the final days of the war, civilians were still streaming west. \\n tl;dr: There are no civilians in a race war. \\n',\n  0),\n ('>The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars/But in ourselves \\n Very often, the lens we view these things through affects what we see.

This was a spectacular thing and everyone talked about it \\n So here\\'s the problem: there are few, if any, dying-and-rising gods.  We have visitors to the underworld who were not dead (Orpheus, Persephone), we have many heroes who weren\\'t gods (Orpheus), we have gods who periodically renew themselves but don\\'t die (Quetzalcoatl), and we have gods who die but don\\'t rise (that is, they stay in the underworld, like Osiris, or many version of Adonis). \\n Most contemporary scholars on the subject feel that the broad category \"dying-and-rising god\" (also called the \"life-death-rebirth god\") is likely gross misinterpretation at worst and definitely over-exaggerated at best.  However, this wasn\\'t really established until J. Z. Smith wrote an essay on it in the \\'80\\'s.  Why did it take more than a 100 years?  Because scholars saw all the other myths through the lens of Jesus, who is, of course, the most famous \"dying-and-rising\" god.  They picked and chose  parts  that made the myth \"Christ-like\" while simply overlooking the parts that absolutely didn\\'t.  Moreover, when there were many versions of the myth, they chose the one that made the character most \"Christ-like\" while ignoring other (often earlier) versions of the myth.  We think Adonis is Christ-like because we pick our evidence from the versions of the Adonis myth in which he is Christ-like, or which ever. For more, see the \" scholarly criticism . \\n Of course, there are some broad similarities in myths, but we have to be very careful in when we see them, and why.  I\\'ve heard arguments that creation myths of people who farm cereals tend to involve a state of chaos and separating chaos from order (and perhaps water from land) while creation myths of people who rely on tubers tend to involve the dismemberment of the first human/god/something.  I haven\\'t read a definitive version of this argument, only seen it broadly alluded to (and for the life of me, I can\\'t remember where), so take that with a grain of salt.  J. Z. Smith in other places says that comparisons must always have three or more parts; just having two is insufficient.  We can\\'t just say \"X is like Y\".  We have to say \"X is like Y in terms of A\", or \"X is more like Y than it is like Z\", or better yet, \"X is more like Y than it is like Z in terms of A (noting, of course, the obvious differences between X and Y in terms of B)\". \\n tl;dr: There  are  some places where myths are meaningfully similar, but many times we think we see similarities, we\\'re just reading the myths we already know into foreign myths while ignoring salient differences. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"It's very gratifying when people name check you in their comments, but now I feel I have to do better than /u/khosikulu, and his explanation is, as always, pretty much spot on. The feeling amongst a lot of leaders was that black cultural identity was repressed and belittled by the white-dominated education systems. This made it difficult to offer up any kind of resistance to racism, because it created a kind of internal racism amongst blacks, in which internal divisions were sown and blacks competed to be as white as possible. There was also a sense that it made blacks 'play by the rules' of e.g. non-violence and constitutional protest, even though whites made no effort to play by the same rules, assaulting black protests and using institutional racism to cut down black aspirations. \\n By creating an 'authentic' cultural base free of European / white assaults on blackness, it was hoped that blacks could coalesce and have the strength to resist racism as equals, not as supplicants. As khosikulu has pointed out, however, the leaders of this movement were well aware that a hundred years or more of colonialism separated blacks from their pre-colonial cultures. As a result, a pretty wide variety of techniques have been used. The Kenyan author Ngugi wa Thiong'o, for example, refuses to write in English and claims that African literature must be written in an 'African' tongue. Poets like Kamau Brathwaite of Barbados and Derek Walcott of Saint Lucia have experimented with 'African' rhythms in their poetry. And anthropologists such as Orlando Patterson, Sidney Mintz, and Melville Herskovits have looked at cultural practices which survived the Middle Passage from Africa to the Caribbean, and thus represent African traditions, albeit evolved ones. \\n My thesis on West Indian literature actually looks at this pretty closely. A number of authors in the 1950s and 1960s attempted to legitimise the use of patois in their novels. Previously, people thought of it as not being 'proper English', even though it was the language used by millions in the Caribbean. By writing novels in this tongue, it was hoped that it would make it easier for other West Indians to tell their stories, and thus allow West Indians to gain some control over their representation in media. In doing so, it was hoped (by some) that they could then use this to free themselves from the political and cultural impositions of North America and Britain. So it was very much an attempt to turn the tables and discover a means of expression not controlled by whites, or at least not controlled by the countries which they perceived repressed them in a number of ways. \\n Outside of culture, this concept has weight in the political sphere. It's interesting that you mention the ANC, because I actually don't think they're a great example of this - they worked closely with the Communist Party of South Africa and other white anti-apartheid activists. A better example would be [Steve Biko] ( a black leader who emerged in the late 1960s. Following the crushing of the ANC, black resistance within South Africa itself had become rare. Biko attempted to reverse this with two famous rallying cries: \\n > 'Black man, you are on your own.' \\n The first, above, was based on Biko's belief that only blacks  could  truly oppose apartheid, and that their white 'helpers' were far too comfortable with the benefits of apartheid to be of assistance. He was particularly scathing about those who promised gradual change - Biko wanted to end apartheid overnight, not wind it down slowly. \\n >'The most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the minds of the oppressed.' \\n The second part of the equation - if blacks continue to use white forms of thought, especially relating to the primitivism and savagery of Africa, they will always consider white subjugation in some ways reasonable. Until they organised together, they would be unable to recognise the true brutality of apartheid and thus resist it. \\n Ultimately, black unity organisations are pretty varied. If they can be broadly united, it would be in their goal of constructing a strong and unified base with which to resist racism and colonialism. They believed that white education denigrated black culture and civilisation, and made it impossible to effectively resist. By unifying, they hoped to inculcate the kind of racial pride they saw as being central to white power. \\n TL;DR:  Khosikulu's right, but have some more examples anyway! \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"It's worth mentioning that as of WW2, Yiddish was often still defined as German dialect, rather than its own language.  A Yiddish speaker can often make themselves understood to a German speaker by choosing mostly German-based words (steering clear of the Semitic and Slavic parts of the vocabulary)--at that point it's mostly the same words with a very different accent.  But a typical Yiddish conversation may include other words.  So one could argue that there were different languages on different sides.  And several countries, such as France and Ukraine, had people fighting on both sides. \\n It also depends how you define a nation having a language.  Arabic is one of Israel's official languages, and though not drafted there are a number of Arabic-speakers in the army.  A significant proportion of Jewish Israelis spoke Arabic as a first language, too. \\n Another example is the troubles.  The Unionists and Republicans mostly spoke English, though the Unionists also speak Scots and Scottish Gaelic, if memory serves, and many Republicans also speak Irish (though mostly as a second language nowadays). \\n tl;dr often language groups split in larger wars, such as WW2.

It's a very fun and exciting (not to mention obscure) topic, although its been infrequently written about. \\n My main problem in the research lies with what was called the Heroes of America, or the Red String Society. In theory it was a secret society of pro-Union (or at least anti-Confederate, or anti-war, or anti-government at all) North Carolinians who did their utmost to hinder the Confederate war effort and/or support peace initiatives. Probably the main way this was done was by trying to convince soldiers at the front to desert (I believe with moderate success). In theory, their activities also included other tactics though, such as sabotage. \\n The problem lies in the fact that these people (for obvious reasons), never wrote down anything (what with the whole treasonous behavior thing). Most of the information there seems to be about this society comes from the opposing side, and given that it was an election year when it came public (1864), I'm forced to hold much of it in high suspicion. \\n Now I'm not really an expert on anything in particular, and I've never been published, but I had some vague notion of making an article out of this.

The major turning point in the Ottoman-Hapsburg wars was the failed Siege of Vienna in 1683; this is around the same time as when William Penn was founding Pennsylvania. The Ottomans would have had to have taken over the major Western merchant countries (Spain and Portugal) which would be pretty tough since by the 1490s the New Monarchy in Spain had exiled or killed most of the Muslims in the Iberian Peninsula. \\n tl;dr The Ottoman Empire did not exist in the right time period to conquer the Americas, there is an ocean and several very powerful European nations in the way, and it wasn't even on the Ottoman radar. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('Oh! This is a  great  question! First off, you\\'re right to make a distinction between \"the draft\" and conscription. They\\'re two  very  different things! \\n \\n A Draft  is when the Army needs a specific number of men to sustain it\\'s forces. Say it needs one hundred men per month. Everyone\\'s name goes on a big list, everyone is randomly assigned into 100 men groups, and get a number. Basically if your name is pulled out of a hat you and your group have to go, but everyone else is off scott free! (Until the next draft). \\n \\n Conscription  is literally the government goes to town and grabs everyone like a greedy kid at a birthday party\\'s snack table. Instead of a lottery system with some people going and some people staying, during conscription everyone registers and is deployed (during \"total\" war this \\'deployment\\' might be the government keeping you a civilian, esp if you\\'ve got an important job like mining or stevedoring. These are not  exempt  jobs, they are  protected  jobs). Don\\'t get me wrong though - with conscription, the government might call up everyone and then even the non-protected folks might be rationed out to the Army slowly, over time. There is still the issue of sustainment to worry about, after all! Of you sent everyone at once, you would suddenly have a massive army you couldn\\'t supply, which would slowly get smaller and less effective over time because you would have no reinforcements to send to cover casualties. \\n \\n \\n Okay, now we\\'ve got that down, let\\'s talk about where these ideas (in their modern form) come from. So we\\'ve got to talk about the French. \\n Firstly, the French are the most war winning people on Earth. Statistically they\\'ve got the best win:loss ratio of any nation. They are ball-shatteringly good at war; it is historically their jam. But when they gave their Monarchy the big middle finger for the first time, they ran into a problem. Every other Monarchy in Europe decided that a polity without a Monarch was setting a bad precedent for their own power structures, and invaded. The first war alone pitted France against a coalition of the Holy Roman Empire, Prussia, Great Britain/UK, Russia, French Monarchists, Spain, Portugal, Sardinia, Naples, the Ottoman Empire, the Dutch Republic, the USA, Haiti (technically), and the Knights of St John of Malta. \\n You can see the French had a problem. But happily, their new ideas about equality, fraternity, and citizenship provided them with a ideological and pragmatic solution. If all men were now citizens and formed the ultimate source from where the State gained authority, then every citizen had the duty to protect the State which they created and which defended them in turn. And so the French state (in the form of the Convention) issued a declaration for something called  Levée en masse . \\n \"From this moment until such time as its enemies shall have been driven from the soil of the Republic, all Frenchmen are in permanent requisition for the services of the armies. The young men shall fight; the married men shall forge arms and transport provisions; the women shall make tents and clothes and shall serve in the hospitals; the children shall turn linen into lint; the old men shall betake themselves to the public squares in order to arouse the courage of the warriors and preach hatred of kings and the unity of the Republic\" \\n This is nothing less than the involuntary mobilisation of every single man, woman, and child in France - justified as necessary for the defence of that State and thus the people which constitute it. Although prior to this people were frequently nabbed for military service involuntarily, it was mostly  ad hoc  and had no justification apart from simple things like \"LOL my sword is bigger\", \"I am your King\", or \"you can fight or you can get slaughtered by some moors\". Levée en masse is totally revolutionary in that it connected involuntary service to citizenship and the defence of the State - it the source of seeing service as an \"obligation\". (French men still do - or did until very recently - at least one day of training in their lives as a part of this). \\n Needless to say, being able to put enormous numbers of men into the field saved the French Republic. The first call put 1,500,000 men into the French uniform, and against what seemed to be overwhelming odds. After demobilising them at the end of the War of the First Coalition, the French were then able to call them all back to win the War of the Second Coalition, basically securing a win for both phases of the French Revolutionary Wars. \\n It was such a powerful tool for winning wars that modern nation-states in Europe eventually regularised and continued the requirement even into peacetime, in different forms. France required a minimum amount of training in amounts depending on your \"classes\" (what year you were born), for instance, as did Germany. All of these things were strongly ideologically linked to the defence of the polity. Considering the enormous armed camp Europe had become, this justification rang true; at a government level it was considered necessary and wise policy. \\n One of the sole European exceptions during this modern period was Britain, which due to geographic and social factors, retained a small and highly professional army in preference. They fought colonial wars, and relied heavily on their Navy. Considering the British system almost instantly broke down in the mud and blood of the First World War, this system was replaced in 1916 by conscription (even though volunteers had been plentiful in the early stages of the war). One interesting note about conscription at this time (late 19th century) is it brought a lot of the middle class into the military, increasing literacy dramatically. \\n \"Drafts\" are a little harder to pin down ideologically - often it is argued that it is more \"fair\" and leaves enough men behind to maintain the economy during a \\'limited war\\'. Russia pre-WW1 had a system, for example, where a peasant was simply drafted from a village for 25 years. Essentially the village was given a certain number of men the Army needed, and was told to see to it. Since this was effectively a life sentence the village elders often picked the unlucky victim from the ranks of the mentally feeble or troublesome, which produced soldiers which were less than ideal. The Americans at Vietnam are another famous example of drafting for \\'limited\\' war. \\n Anyway, I hope this was useful! \\n TL:DR Conscription came about ideologically during the French Revolutionary Wars. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Leaving aside the issue of the term \"Founding Fathers\" for now, I find that the question is confusing. \\n This is now my fifth attempt at answering it, and so I\\'ve decided to answer what I  think  you meant by it. \\n Was there a financial motive involved in the Revolutionary War? Of course there was. Much of the policies of the British government since the ending of the French & Indian War had been targeted towards recouping the costs of that war. These policies invariably led to protest as the colonists felt them too harsh, or too restrictive, or passed without proper authority. \\n Some more famous examples polices include the Stamp Act, and of course the Tea Act of 1773 (which would lead to the Boston Tea Party). The restriction of settlement west of the Appalachians was a big concern to a vast number of Americans, as this would restrict growth and stability for tens of thousands of them. \\n In  1775: A Good Year For Revolution  Kevin Phillips has identified 12 serious economic confrontations that led to strife with Britain and that played a role in the lead up to the Revolutionary War. \\n 1.) The first issue was a \". . . money supply kept small, primitive, and usually inadequate by British mercantilist thinking and administrative practice. \\n A reduced monetary supply severely restricts economic growth. \\n 2.) The second issue was debt. Debt was rampant everywhere in the colonies, and the British policies towards debt collection could be excessively burdensome to the colonists,  especially  given the limited money supply. \\n 3.) Trade policies. The Navigation Acts determined what goods the American colonies could export and to where. The restriction of markets hampered economic growth as well. \\n 4.) Taxation. This comes to us in the handy slogan \"No taxation without representation\", and was a huge concern for American colonists, both as a practical matter and one of principle. \\n 5.) Related to taxation was the idea of unfair enumeration. The colonists argued that not only did Parliament not have the right to tax Americans because there was no representation, they also argued that the enumerated lists were already a form of taxation that placed an unfair burden on the American colonists. \\n 6.) Customs racketeering. In the early 1760s a series of laws were passed which cracked down on the smuggling of goods. Some of these laws were quite draconian. For example a customs officer could board a ship, and seize the ship and the entire cargo for carrying contraband if he saw a sailor with a bottle of personal rum that wasn\\'t on the manifest. Then the owner of the ship would have to pay a deposit to go to court. He would then have to prove that he  wasn\\'t  smuggling, and even if he won his court case he was still responsible for payment of court costs and fees. Plus this payment had be made in hard currency, of which there was a limited supply. This was a major bone of contention in New England and led to such acts of protest as the burning of the  Gaspee  in 1773. \\n 7.) Economic boycotts. The non-importation agreements following the Stamp Act are well known. \\n 8.) Conflict over manufacturing. In addition to restrictions on trade there were also restrictions on what could be manufactured in the colonies. \\n 9.) The extra-legal nature of the various committees to enforce non-importation was another source of conflict that was tied to economics. \\n 10.) British hostility towards westward expansion was another economic factor. The Proclamation Line of 1763 angered many Americans who saw a future in expansion beyond the Appalachians. \\n 11.) The Quebec Act of 1774 was another major bone, as it placed what would become Ohio , Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin into the political realm of French-speaking (and to make matters worse Catholic) Quebec. \\n 12.) The arms race of 1775 was another economic issue as Congress relaxed it\\'s non-exportation agreements to allow for more arms and munitions to be purchased in the lead up to independence. \\n So yes, there definitely was some economic aspect to the war. However, it wasn\\'t until the passage of the Coercive Acts in 1774 that the movement towards rebellion really began in earnest. Before that point many (maybe even most) wanted to see America have more independence  within  the British Empire, but not to be truly independent. \\n Even as late as 1774 most Americans weren\\'t pushing for independence. \\n Nearly four months after the Boston Tea Party (which Adams called the \"most magnificent Movement of all\", there still hadn\\'t been any official response from England. John Adams wrote a letter at the beginning of April to James Warren, who was a leading Whig. In it Adams says this; \\n >News We have none. Still—Silent as Midnight. The first Vessells may bring us tidings, which will erect the Crests of the Tories again and depress the Spirits of the Whiggs. For my own Part, I am of the same opinion that I have been for many Years, that there is not Spirit enough on Either side to bring the Question to a compleat Decision —and that We shall oscilate like a Pendulum and fluctuate like the Ocean, for many Years to come, and never obtain a compleat Redress of American Grievances, nor submit to an absolute Establishment of Parliamentary Authority. But be trimming between both as we have been for ten Years past, for more Years to come than you and I shall live. Our Children, may see Revolutions, and be concerned and active in effecting them of which we can form no Conception. \\n As late as April 9, 1774 Adams was of the opinion that no decision would be forced for years to come. Yet by the fall of 1774 towns all over New England were conducting mass protests against the British government. Juries were refusing to be seated. Courts were being forced to close and court officials were being forced to recant their oaths of office. In September tens of thousands of militia would mobilize over rumors that Boston had been shelled by the British. \\n General Gage would be directly confronted by three thousand militia in a display of authority, and would have to back down. \\n What changed? Well in May 1774 the response from England came. The Coercive Acts did more to unite and galvanize resistance to Britain than perhaps anything else had done in America to that point. The Coercive Acts were economic in nature (at least partly), but the biggest thing in them was the Massachusetts Governing Act which shut down Massachusetts government. The 1691 Massachusetts charter was regarded as a \"sacred covenant\". So much so that in a town meeting on August 6, 1774 officials in the town of Worcester, MA said “that an attempt to vacate said charter, by either party, without the consent of the other, has a tendency to dissolve the union between Great Britain and this province, to destroy the allegiance we owe to the king, and to set aside the sacred obligations he is under to his subjects here.” \\n A month later the town of Worcester would instruct it\\'s Provincial Congress representative to push for independence in the meeting of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress. \\n TL,DR \\n Yes, economics did play a big role in the resentment towards Britain. Economic policies were regarded as unfair. However they were seen in the context of a larger picture which was that of the abuse of English rights, and it wasn\\'t until the Coercive Acts that colonists were motivated enough to rebel. \\n Some sources: \\n 1.)  1775: A Good Year for Revolution  by Kevin Phillips.

If you want a ELI5 answer, most people will go with the year 1717 as a founding date- but things are a bit more detailed than that. \\n Here are the basics: \\n \\n In 1717, the  UGLE  was founded. Today, legitimate Masonic lodges derive their official status from being formally recognized by UGLE. This helps you avoid joining a lodge that\\'s trying to scam you, or one that\\'s injecting their own non-Masonic teachings into Masonry. \\n \\n Everything today is structured in a \"Grand Lodge\" model, where each state in the US has its own Grand Lodge that independently carries out administrative duties within that state, each in turn being recognized by UGLE. There is no national overseeing Masonic body, and no worldwide Masonic body. UGLE recognition is a matter of legitimacy rather than hierarchy. \\n \\n While 1717 was the start date for the modern Grand Lodge model (as a result of four lodges in England getting together to found the UGLE), it\\'s self-evident that those four lodges (as well as additional lodges) existed prior to 1717, and were seeking to standardize what they\\'d already been practicing for a long time. \\n \\n There are solid records going back into the 1600s of Masonic lodges in England acting in a manner that look like what we consider Freemasonry to be today, with some minor differences. \\n \\n \\n Once you start getting into the early 1600s and before, no one has a definitive claim on what was going on. That being said, plenty of people write books speculating about what was happening during this time. Many people try and tie Freemasonry to the Knights Templar, but these connections lack sufficient evidence to stand up to scrutiny. They\\'re not impossible, just not supported sufficiently. \\n There\\'s also the question of when things transitioned from \"operative Masonry\" to \"speculative Masonry\" (essentially when Lodges transitioned from being solely guilds of actual stonemasons with their own rituals into Lodges that allowed individuals from other professions that modeled rituals after stonemason traditions). There\\'s not a solid answer for when this happened, but it would be fair to say that it was some time during the Middle Ages. \\n At this point, we can get into the question of manuscripts. The earliest of these is the [Halliwell Manuscript, also known as the Regius Poem]( from 1390. Having read through the translation of it, I can say that there are some very clear but subtle phrases used that leave me personally without a doubt that Freemasonry, in some form, existed at this point in time. Admittedly, it was likely a distant cousin of what we now know. This manuscript makes a claim about Masonry being brought to England in the 900s AD, but the trail really goes cold at this point. \\n TLDR; 1717 is an easy date to reference, lots going on in the 1600s, scattered details from 1300-1600 that are fun to speculate on, and insufficient evidence before that. \\n',\n  0),\n ('To add on to the first question: \\n For your second question: \\n Spoken highland and lowland languages are not easily mutually intelligible. Most people consider a highland language like K\\'iche\\' an entirely separate language from a lowland one like Ch\\'ol or Mopan. Sometimes vocabulary is clearly connected. K\\'iche\\' numbers go \"Jun, kieb/keb, ox, kajib, job, waqib, wuqub\" and classic lowland ones are \"Jun, cha\\', ux, chan, ho, waq, wuk\" \"Ch\" often becomes \"k\", the plularish ending \"-ib\" appears. Spoken, though, it\\'s very tough. The very glottal \"Q\" is distinct from the frontal \"K\" much more so in the highlands than elsewhere, while most highland languages don\\'t differentiate long and short vowels (this is literally the length of the sound, not the quality). Many modern Maya are able to understand another language other than their own, but not without specifically learning it. \\n But what about writing? First, Maya glyphs are contain both logograms and syllables with preference for either depending on the region or scribe himself. Let\\'s take a look at this common phrase [\"Chumwan ti ajawle\"]( \"He is seated into lordship.\"  Chum  is your standard logogram, it\\'s the big square on the left that\\'s basically a cross-section of a guy sitting cross-legged. The wavy line and two bumps beneath it are the syllables \"wa\" and \"ni,\" spelling out the passive suffix for positional verbs, \"waan.\" \\n The corresponding K\\'iche\\' phrase is \"kak\\'ub\\'an\" The K\\'iche\\' word for \"seated\" is \"k\\'u,\" again showing the \"ch\"/\"k\" difference. \"Ka\" is the incompletive aspect marker, usually assumed, not written, in glyphs. \"B\\'an\" is the passive marker. So if a highlander knew the sign  he could read it as \"k\\'u\" or \"chum\" and it wouldn\\'t matter. It\\'s not inherently linked to the classic lowland Maya language (there\\'s debate on what it\\'s called, we\\'ll say Ch\\'olan for ease). But then there\\'s the suffix. Even if you can read it as \"waan\" and know what it sounds like, you\\'re nowhere without prior knowledge of Ch\\'olan. You might be able to guess, since it\\'s the most similar suffix. \\n The next part of the phrase requires much more knowledge of Ch\\'olan, since it\\'s so syllabic. I\\'ve color-coded individual parts [here]( Blue is the syllable \"ti,\" which can be used in spelling words or on it\\'s own as the preposition \"into.\" \"Pa\" would be the K\\'iche\\' equivalent; no similarity there. Orange is the word \"ajaw,\" an standard abbreviation with just the \"ja\" and \"wa\" syllables. The word is the same for most highland languages, but you need to know this convention to read it. Green is \"le,\" again, either a syllable as part of a word or the noun suffix roughly akin to our \"-ship.\" \\n To throw one more difficulty in there, let\\'s go back to  chum.  Here\\'s another [appearance]( of it. Notice how the first one has a different symbol where the \"arm\" should be in the little circle? The first has a version the \"wa\" syllable there. This goes along with the suffix. The second  chum  has this [sign]( the syllable \"mu.\" This is called a phonetic complement, you see it within alongside a lot of logograms. It reinforces the ending consonant of the logogram. And, as a side-effect, makes it clear that this word is  not  the K\\'iche\\'  k\\'u . \\n Of course, this all assumes that a highlander would be able to read the glyphs in the first place. If they could, it would be rather like me, with good knowledge of Spanish and Latin,  reading French. I can push through it and approximate things on paper, but I could never speak or listen to it. Again, it is likely that folks back then did speak multiple Maya languages like they do now, but that kind of avoids the question. (we do see intrusions of Yucatec Maya into Ch\\'olan texts, and even spellings of Nahuatl names in the post-Classic codices) \\n TL;DR  The integration of logorams and syllables in most Maya glyph texts would make it very difficulty for someone without familiarity w/ Ch\\'olan to read them well. \\n',\n  0),\n ('I\\'m not a historian, but I wrote a paper on how East Germany dealt with the legacy of fascism while I studied abroad in Berlin, so I\\'ve dusted that off. I can\\'t speak to how W. Germany dealt with it, though, so I\\'ll give half the picture and I\\'m sure someone else will come along with the other half. (Jesus Christ this became a lot longer than I anticipated, sorry in advance.) \\n The DDR (E. Germany), to begin with, had a problem of establishing state legitimacy that the BRD (W. Germany) didn\\'t really have. To gain this legitimacy, the DDR essentially built up a \"foundation myth\" of sorts entirely centered on the history of communism in Germany. The liberation of the concentration camps (especially Buchenwald) was attributed to communist-led resistance within the camps. The promulgated narrative was of German communists leading ethnically and politically diverse bands of antifascists from within Germany itself to conquer fascism. \\n So, in tune with this narrative, after the workers\\' uprising in June 1953, which attested to the shaky legitimacy of the Communist regime, Buchenwald was turned into a national memorial, and a memorial was erected to Ernst Thaelmann, the murdered leader of the Weimar-era Communist Party of Germany, at the Buchenwald crematorium. \\n Like Jews were forced to wear a gold star, communist victims in the Holocaust were forced to wear a red triangle, which became a symbol of heroic resistance in art. Socialist realist novelists like Marchwitza, Bredel, and Gotsche told stories spanning generations, constructing a specifically German socialist tradition, progressing from defeat to ultimate salvation by the Red Army. \\n East German historians used Marxist linearity and \"historical materialism\" to link the Communist Party to uprisings in German history like the medieval Peasants\\' War and the 1848 revolution. Marxist thought considers socialism the natural result of revolution stemming from the oppression of the proletariat inherent in capitalist structures, so Marxist East German historians re-interpreted fascism as the last gasp of the elites to protect their interests from the laborers. With this re-interpretation, antifascism and anticapitalism became more or less synonymous. The Berlin Wall was characterized as the \"[antifascist protective wall]( \\n German monopolists were blamed for instigating WWII, and the non-resisting majority were not accounted for. WWII was a story of the superior social structures of the socialists inevitably defeating imperial fascists, and the DDR really pushed the narrative that it had always been communist and was the first victim of Nazi aggression. Non-communist Nazi resistance, the racial aspect of Nazism, and the mass collaboration allowing for the SS terror system went largely unmentioned. Mass exterminations were largely left out of the narrative as well, because DDR historians were only allowed to understand Nazism in the economic sense of state monopoly capitalism. Non-political victims of the Third Reich were by and large ignored. \\n Because of the \"scientific\" inevitability of Marxist history, individuals were largely absolved from blame, and the lesson taken from the rise of fascism was something akin to \"don\\'t be capitalist.\" As (at least according to the narrative) antifascists, East Germany considered itself a co-victor in WWII. My paper has a quote from a DDR student saying \"When I imagined WWII as a child, it was as if everyone had somehow been a member of the White Rose or had met secretively in back courtyards and basements to organize resistance and print pamphlets.\" \\n Naturally, considering the official historical narrative, many former Nazis made careers in the East German regime. Arno von Lenski, for instance, was an assessor of the Volksgerichthof in Nazi Germany, in a capacity where his signature was appended to multiple death sentences, but in the DDR, Ulbricht awarded him the \"Medal for Fighters against Fascism 1933-45.\" Ernst Grossmann was an SS guard at Sachsenhausen, which largely housed political prisoners, and served on the Central Committee of SED in the DDR, and was decorated as a \"Hero of Work.\" These are two of many examples of the blind eye turned towards the contributions of individual collaborators in the Nazi regime. \\n On committees such as the  Opfer des Faschismus  (Victims of Fascism) and the Union of Persecuted of the Nazi Regime (VVN), both party-sanctioned groups, non-political victims were originally included, but by the late \\'40s were already marginalized. Even non-communist political victims, like the supporters of the July 20 coup, were excluded from the VVN in 1949. \\n Entire concentration camps were forgotten in the official record, like Marzahn, which held Sinti and Roma but not communists. It took until the 1980s until DDR historians could discuss Jewish persecution and bourgeois antifascist opposition, but even in 1984 lesbians were arrested for visiting Ravensbrueck, the site of persecutions of homosexuals. The Volkskammer did not accept German responsibility for the Holocaust until April 12, 1990. \\n Sources: \\n Brinks, J.H. \"Poilitcal Anti-Fascism in the German Democratic Republic.\"  Journal of Contemporary History  32.2 (1997): 207-17. \\n Diner, Dan. \"On the Ideology of Antifascism.\" Trans.

Parliamentary democracies are just one of a few ways of implementing the enlightenment idea of the Trias Politica, wherein there is a legislature, an executive power and a judiciary. All democracies ask the question \"Who ought to rule,\" and answer: \"The People.\" The people are the sole foundation upon which legitimate power can be based. How the people should exercise their rule is another question entirely. \\n What everyone agrees on is that each part of the trias should be democratically legitimate. This means that, at least abstractly and theoretically, there should be a causal link between various elections and the government\\'s power structures. For example (while I am a law student I also do not live anywhere close to America so correct me if I\\'m wrong) in America judges are appointed by the President, the Senate or state legislatures. The judiciary derives its legitimacy from the fact that the people have chosen the people who have chosen the judges. I\\'d be surprised if there was a country where the judiciary is democratically elected. \\n So, while all democracies have directly elected parliaments and indirectly legitimized judiciaries, the big difference is in how the executive branch is given its democratic legitimacy and what the relationship parliament-executive-judiciary looks like. If the executive branch is one directly elected politician who then picks his cabinet, then it\\'s probably a presidential democracy. Since both the legislative branch (parliament) and the executive branch (the president) are democratically elected, neither is responsible to one another. The American system is a perfect example of this kind of democracy, where each branch of government has its own powers and where neither branch has the upper hand (in theory, most of the time). \\n Lots of democracies, however, do not hold specific elections for the executive branch and end up indirectly electing the executive power. This is what you meant. People vote in general elections and then from the result of these elections the winning parties must form a coalition in order to have a majority in the legislature in order to be able to exercise power. Ministers come from the ruling parties. In the Netherlands, which is a good example of such a system (just like Sweden, Denmark, Spain and some others) it was considered to be a good thing if the Prime Minister was  not  from the biggest party, so that he could try to strive for cohesion and consensus in the political process. Some consider this to be utter bullcrap and the practice was abandoned in the eighties anyway. Even though most Prime Ministers don\\'t have any actual duties besides presiding over cabinet meetings and being the de-facto or actual heads of state (in some constitutional monarchies the head of state is still the royal), it can be seen as a good thing that the head of state should come from the biggest party, as that would give them the greatest possible legitimacy. Basically in a democracy of this kind, minsters come from those parties that are able to form a majority in parliament and Prime Ministers usually but not necessarily come from the largest party. Because they derive their legitimacy from parliament they are also responsible  to  parliament and can be removed from office by a vote of no confidence, which is something I could write a lot about but I won\\'t right now because this is gonna get long. I\\'ll just say that in some countries it\\'s considered such an essential mechanism in the political system that  it\\'s not even codified in law . If you get a vote of no confidence you just  have  to leave, because otherwise the system would explode. \\n There are also lots of systems that are somewhere in between, such as Germany where the Bundespräsident (the president) is elected by a metric assload of state and regional representatives and theoretically holds the right of veto over all federal laws but who, since no Bundespräsident has used his veto in over fifty years, in practice is nothing more than a figurehead. However, this president, who is at best indirectly democratically legitimized (how do the people know who their representatives are going to vote for,) then has the right to propose a candidate for the office of Bundeskanzler (Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel) who is the constitutional head of state and holds about a thousand times more power than the Präsident. I\\'m sure the German system of indirectly elected officials electing other officials isn\\'t the quirkiest or most interesting in the world, but it\\'s just one of many systems that fall somewhere in between \\'constitutional monarchy\\' and \\'presidential democracy\\' and it goes to show that it\\'s hard to make generalizations about political organization based on a few Western European countries. \\n Anyway, this is all the stuff I know off the top of my head and with only a quick glance into my textbooks, I\\'m not a scholar of comparative constitutional law and it\\'s real late so I\\'m sorry about any inaccuracies, omissions, simplifications, the wordiness and other such deficiencies of my post.

Hospitality, and the institution of Xenos - often translated as guest-friendship - was very important in ancient Greece for a few reasons. A big part of it was, yes, that travel was just dangerous, especially by road. I don't know that 'class distinctions' really play a role in making travel difficult, as much as bandits, getting lost, unfriendly locals and wild animals. \\n At least amongst the upper classes (for whom travel was a more realistic and frequent prospect) there was a network of guest-friends that each family maintained. These allowed a family member to have access to a number of other families in different areas who would be honor bound to provide hospitality to family members of their guest-friends. Travelers would have a place to stay, to sleep and eat, local information and safety. \\n Imagine if you had a religious duty to accept couch surfers from  particular families. Also, you would know that you could send your kids off on a holiday, and some family member of that guy who stayed at your place would have to accept your kids. \\n Having this kind of network in place - and being able to trust in it - was pretty essential (iirc from my undergrad days) to being able to travel safely, so it's understandable that there was a lot of cultural pressure to stick to the rules. I mean, if you didn't hold up your end for guests, what's in it for other's to provide that for you and your family when you need it? \\n A lot of the social pressure came with the weight of religious expectations. This was a pretty codified system - you could point to exactly who was and who wasn't your Xenos. Mistreating or harming someone who's your guest-friend was seen as irreligious or at least inauspicious (again, iirc), as well as not honourable. \\n There is a story from the illiad of two warriors who don't fight each other, because there is a Xenos relationship between their families. That gives some idea of how esteemed the relationship was, even if the event itself is poetic embellishment. \\n The guest-friendship system also had benefits as a form of networking - it was a good way to get information from far off places and feel more comfortable with the reliability of that information. And of course it helped a lot with facilitating business opportunities. \\n But that's all quest-friendship, that's not quite the same as hospitality towards strangers. Still, the TLDR here is that without a system of places to stay, travel was very dangerous. Hence, if you wanted to travel, it was worth your while to be nice to travelers and this developed religious force behind it. \\n One final point, which might be a bit unhistorical - i'm gonna generalise pretty heavily here. You ask if other cultures around that time share the same values - just about every culture in the world does. Industrial-capitalist western nations' cultures (which i'm just presuming you come from) tend to stress hospitality very little, compared to other cultures. I'd say this comes from the cult of individualism that strongly capitalist and industrial cultures tend to foster. So while it may seem like a strong emphasis on hospitality in greek culture, perhaps it would look normal for someone from a  middle eastern, asian or eastern european background - all of which tend towards more emphasis on hospitality than US/UK/AUS etc. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"Well, I can tell you as a modern Christian, at least in my school, sex wasn't bad at all, only if done outside of wedlock (and for some people if it's gay sex, but that wasn't a universal idea, contrary to popular belief).

Between the time Christianity was founded and the modern era ideas about sex stayed pretty much the same. The majority of people still had little qualms about recreational sex. But more fundamentalist sects around the reformation (1600s) began to interpret parts of the Bible as hostile to all sex, not just sex out of wedlock. These sects, one of which I think were the Quakers(?), used these very strict interpretations to come to the conclusion that sex is only for reproduction and all other sex is sinful. Past this I don't know anything, except Victorian England had alot of taboos about sex that I think are based on these ideas. \\n tl;dr- Most Christians think sex is awesome.

The narrative that I have heard is that Vladimir sent his representatives to each of the major religions nearby: Orthodox Christianity, \"German\" (or catholic) Christianity, Judaism (Khazars), and to the Muslims in Bulgaria. The envoys found Catholoicism to be too \"gloomy\", the muslim Bulgarians too smelly (and the restrictions on pork and alcohol unappealing), and the diaspora of the Jews to be a sign that their God had abandoned them.

In actuality, Vladimir\\'s conversion (and thus the conversion of the Rus\\') was a result of an alliance with the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine). The ruler of the Empire at the time was Basil II. Basil had fought a number of campaigns against the Bulgarians to his north, and although he was successful in many of these campaigns, the Bulgarians were still a threat. The Byzantines and Rus\\' had a rocky history with one another; on one hand the Emperor\\'s personal guard was made up largely of Scandanavian and Rus\\' mercenaries, while on the other raiders from the Rus\\' had made numerous attacks on the Empire, including several raids on Constantinople itself. The Kievan Rus\\' bordered the Tsardom of Bulgaria, and thus would make an excellent ally for Basil against the Bulgarians. Vladimir had also fought the Bulgarians in the past, and would look favorably on alliance with the mighty Byzantines. Accordingly, Basil arranged an alliance with Vladimir. To secure this alliance, Basil took the unprecedented step of marrying his sister, Anna, to Vladimir. This was an unheard of step, to marry an Imperial princess to a slavic barbarian. In particular, it was unacceptable for a princess to marry a pagan. Therefore, because Anna (and the alliance with Basil) was such a prize, Vladimir agreed to convert to Christianity, and thus the Rus\\' converted as well.

These two areas each had their own parliament, cabinet, and prime minister. There were varying degrees of suffrage and ethnic minorities like the Czechs could often wield a reasonable degree of power. The army, navy, and foreign ministries, as well as the head of state under the Hapsburg crown, however, were shared between the two nations. Every year, each legislature would send (elect?) a \"Delegation\" to meet in either Vienna or Budapest (it alternated each year) to hash out the common budgets for these ministries. This was often a source of tension between two ostensibly independent nations, especially over the navy [as you can read here]( but it actually functioned surprisingly well until put under the duress of extended war. \\n TL;DR: Austria and Hungary were essentially two separate sovereign nations which shared a common army, navy, foreign policy, and head of state. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"David McConaughy, who was a Gettysburg local and served as captain of a Union scout company, had begun petitioning for the creation of a national cemetery in the Gettysburg area prior to the actual Battle of Gettysburg. There was little local support, as only a few Union soldiers had been buried in the area. Following the battle, he arranged with the wife of the Evergreen Cemetery's caretaker to inter some of the Union casualties therein. Using those burials as justification, McConaughy almost immediately resumed his petitioning for a national cemetery that would cover the surrounding area, where thousands of soldiers had been buried. He started buying lots of land in the cemetery hill area adjacent and surrounding the Evergreen Cemetery, and convinced veteran's groups to also contribute funds as well. \\n Surprisingly swiftly, the National Cemetery was dedicated in November of that year, and among the dedication ceremonies was the Gettysburg Address by Lincoln.

Most public school textbooks emphasize the actions of the officially accepted great men of American history in the arena of science--Edison, Ford, Rockefeller, etc. People like Tesla, who did not conform to the dominant narrative, were left out of this narrative early on. By the post-WWII time period these narratives were solidified in textbooks. For decades most Americans bought into this narrative in regard to the history of science and technology because most Americans did not have the knowledge or skills to know it was bull shit. Most people who study science at a collegiate level quickly see that there were far more people involved in scientific achievement than are given credit... but most Americans don\\'t study science at a collegiate level. Further, the Official narrative of science isn\\'t challenged by lesser voices because most people simple don\\'t know the alternatives.

An ever-growing number of Americans are going to college, playing on the internet, and exploring knowledge.

(If only because it gives me hope that more than, like, four people might want to read my dissertation someday) \\n Americans certainly did not ignore the French Revolution. In fact, they were practically obsessed with it. Reaction to the beginning of the Revolution proper in 1789 was almost uniformly positive. Part of this was due to their relationship with France during the American Revolution, and part of it was due to the sense that America had lit a flame of liberty that was spreading through the world, beginning with France. One writer claimed, \"France, influenced no doubt, by that unerring providence which directs the affairs of men, stept forward to our assistance with its fleets and armies, and rescued our afflicted cause from apparent destruction. Hence Gratitude has become the principle of affection and friendship in every true American bosom.\" (source:  National Gazette , May 25, 1793) \\n But initially, the Revolution wasn\\'t pictured as a conflict between the people and the king. Remember that in its earliest stages, the French Revolution was not as openly antagonistic towards Louis XIV as it would later be. There was still a possibility that the French would emulate the English model and create a limited monarchy, after all. Americans would have almost certainly been content with a limited monarchy in France, at least initially. \\n However, the growing radicalism in France stoked Americans to new levels of radicalism. By 1793, as Revolutionary France found itself embroiled in warfare, there was much public pressure for America to join in the effort. President Washington cut this off with the Neutrality Proclamation in April, 1793. In retrospect, John Adams claimed that pro-French and anti-neutrality feeling might have caused a revolution in Philadelphia. However, a Yellow Fever epidemic that summer took the air out of the sentiment. \\n Once news reached the United States of Louis\\'s execution, there was some debate about the very question you\\'re asking. This argument revolved around the trope of \"Gratitude\" for French aid. Some Americans argued that the nation owed its gratitude to Louis himself. In response, a writer styling himself \"Philadelphus\" wrote a widely reprinted column for the June 8, 1793 issue of the  National Gazette , rebutting these beliefs, and arguing that Louis was guilty and deserved to be punished: \\n >I cannot perceive upon what ground or principle any one, but particularly any American, can undertake to use the cruel language against France and the revolution, some times uttered in particular circles of this city, and echoed in certain newspapers. Nor can I ever believe, where ignorance or misinformation cannot be pleaded, that any who do use this language, are in their hearts either true Americans or sincere republicans... Kings are no where any longer held to be divine. That blasphemous folly has vanished before the dawn of reason and truth... Gratitude, I perceive, is now a cant word in the mouths of all who endeavour to alienate the good wishes of America from the cause of liberty in France, by exciting our pity and compassion for the unhappy Louis. Some have gone so far as to tell us in the newspapers, that all our obligations were to the king, not to the people or nation of France. \\n One of my favorite stories from this period involves a group of elite Philadelphians celebrating the execution of Louis at a dinner party. A decapitated roast pig was brought out, and each of the guests donned a liberty cap, stabbed the pig, and yelled \"Tyrant!\" (source: Howard Mumford Jones,  America and French Culture  (1965), 541.) \\n While Washington\\'s neutrality proclamation prevented state aid to France, some lent aid to the revolutionary cause. A few Americans travelled to France themselves. Stateside, there was some much talk about raising money to send to the French cause, but it\\'s unclear whether that happened. A few Americans briefly schemed with the French minister, Edmond Genet, to attack the vessels of other European powers as privateers, and to attack Spanish Louisiana. \\n Some Americans certainly sympathized with Louis against the revolutionaries, but I would characterize this group as a distinct minority. Later, around 1798, after Americans turned against France, they rethought their revolutionary narrative. Elijah Parish, a preacher, told his congregation in 1799, \"Be jealous of those, who preach about gratitude to France for her insidious favors. She helped to break our Chains! Thank God, we never wore any.\" In 1798, Reverend Israel Woodward of Connecticut actually argued that France owed America gratitude for its neutrality during the French Revolutionary wars. But by his time, with hostility between France and America growing, he (one assumes) yelled to his audience: \"behold the duplicity, the fickleness, and above all, the ingratitude of that inconstant nation!\" \\n TL;DR: Americans largely supported the French Revolutionaries over the Bourbons, although there was some debate about this. \\n',\n  0),\n ('A lot of this comes down to how you define \"civilisation\".

From memory, Childe\\'s ten characteristics were; \\n 1) A written language \\n 2) Long distance trade \\n 3) Large settlements with high population density \\n 4) Monumental architecture \\n 5) Predictive sciences (e.g. astronomy, meteorological, calendrical etc.) \\n 6) Organised religion \\n 7) The existence of non-food producing specialists \\n 8) The collection, storage, and distribution of surplus by a centra authority \\n 9) A stratified social system with ruling elite \\n 10) Figurative art \\n I may have forgotten something in there somewhere, there\\'s definitely something about residence based group membership (rather than family based) but I forget exactly where that fits in. \\n Those characteristics aren\\'t a checklist - arguably a number of SE Asian and Mesoamerican civilisations (e.g. Khmer, Rajarata Maya etrc.), lacked the high density settlements (instead featuring low-density urban forms).  The Indus may have lacked a written language (as we still haven\\'t deciphered the Indus script) and we still don\\'t understand the Indus social system. \\n The point is, civilisation is a particular form of human society. \\n Gobekli Tepe is a single site, likely some sort of temple, and was not the product of a civilisation.

Mergarh dates to around the beginning of the 7th millennium BCE, but the Indus Civilisation didn\\'t develop the characteristics of a civilisation until the early 3rd millennium BCE. \\n Tl;dr  The earliest civilisation in the world is still Sumerian (Uruk to be precise)- our understanding of this Bronze Age society is still developing, but you\\'re looking at a date of c. 3100-3500BCE \\n',\n  0),\n (\"As far as the first Blackadder series goes, there never was a Richard IV, after the Battle of Bosworth Field, Henry Tudor claims the crown as Henry VII and the Tudor Dynasty begins. The first series is essentially an alternate history in which Henry never takes the throne, which is instead claimed by Richard Duke of York as the new king Richard IV. The character is entirely fictional, though Richard III did have a nephew Richard who was Duke of York and second son of King Edward IV who disappeared under dubious circumstances during his uncle's rise to power. \\n In general though, the series tends to play off of traditional stereotypes for laughs (albeit good ones). So as far as any accurate depiction of life in 15th century medieval England goes, we're pretty well out of luck. Edmund would not have been the Duke of Edinburgh, for Scotland was still independent at the time. For that matter, the Scotsman Douglas McAngus is depicted wearing a kilt, which would not come into fashion until the 16th century. Really, there's more inaccuracies than accuracies. \\n However, there are a couple of interesting points. Although Edmund bungles the thing more often than not, the War of the Roses was an incredibly unstable time in English history, and plots by members and other relations of the royal family to shake up the succession were not out of place or uncommon, Richard III being a prime example. Also, members of the nobility, particularly second or third sons, could enter the clergy and support their family's claims from within the Church, as Edmund does as Archbishop of Canterbury, though I think it would be unlikely for the second son of a king to enter the clergy. By the 15th and 16th centuries, extra princes usually played second-string to the throne, or, in the case that the king was their nephew, acted as a sort of counselor until the king came of age. \\n And just as an addendum, Edmund's companion, Lord Percy Percy is (loosely) based off the Percy family, who were the Earls of Northumberland during the War of the Roses and significant power players in everything that went down. \\n TL;DR The first series is intended as an alternate history and the jokes play off typical stereotypes of late medieval England that are based more on popular perception than reality, but like any stereotype, there are some tidbits or kernels of truth that sneak in, buried underneath everything, that help to frame the episodes. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"Back when I was doing Egyptology almost exclusively I had to know pretty good French and at least some German to sift through a lot of sources, and I also acquired the hieroglyphic portion of the Ancient Egyptian language. \\n Then I shifted to general Classics, which required me to learn Latin, Medieval Latin and Ancient Greek.

Seriously? The contribution was major, but Sharpe is obviously an exaggeration. \\n First, it should be noted that the Spanish were fighting against the British moments before the war, and there was some rivalries between the two. The war started all of sudden, with Napoleon having his troops on the Peninsula and the king abdicating on Napoleon. Brutal repression ignited the spark that was needed: the army (which was quite large, ~100.000-150.000 depending on the source). On that Napoleon ruled Europe and his army was, for the most part, undefeated. In fact, one would think that all was lost until  Bailén , but it was an important symbol: the french could be defeated, even with militia (although a large part of the Spanish side was by regulars, but about that later). \\n The British offered to help Portugal, which was defended more or less easily, since the French couldn\\'t cope with Spain and Portugal. Although the tale of Bailén spread quickly, the French had a lot to say. Following Bailén, there was a series of small campaigns that didn\\'t end well for Spain.

But more importantly, on 1812 Wellington took the lead, and with his British-Portuguese army, he took Salamanca (West) and allowed the Spanish army at the south to push.

That way, you had a fresh a mobile force ready to pursue and kill an enemy after his formation broke. This also meant that breaking formation was often a death sentence. Defense against cavalry never changed much, it was all about keeping together and pointing sharp things at the horses, if you broke into a loose formation, you had to have sharpend stakes around or a solid formation to fall back to (this is what skirmishers relied on) or the cavalry will ride you down at first chance. \\n TL;DR - Cavalry are the sheep dogs of the battlefield, herding infantry together since forever. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('Now I\\'m not necessarily an expert in the training methods of each of the different eras mentioned above, but I\\'ll give it a shot based on a general knowledge of military history and the relationship between spear armed heavy infantry and their primary antagonists (first other heavy infantry, then cavalry-- against archers there\\'s not a lot you can do as spearmen).  Here are a few things to keep in mind about the goals of training a unit of pike/spear, which can lead us to infer about methods. \\n 1) When someone says that teaching someone to use a spear is easy, that\\'s because for the individual there isn\\'t necessarily a lot of technique.  These guys aren\\'t doing the crazy martial arts things you see them do in 300-- they\\'re mostly just stabbing, if even that.  There\\'s a debate among scholars of Ancient Greece about the extent to which spears were actually used in hoplite battles, with an entire school of thought basically arguing that they just pushed with shields until the other side broke.  This leads us into... \\n 2) Unit cohesion is the most important thing that you can train for.  The Spartans (who for a long time were the only Greeks who actually trained for battle on a regular basis, as training is expensive in terms of man hours lost from more productive occupations) were famous for being able to walk evenly forward without breaking formation or moving to the side (its natural, when you\\'re scared, to try to edge toward the side of you that is being protected by your neighbor\\'s shield, which when everyone does it moves the whole formation sideways). \\n Similarly, most battle casualties came from when the losing side would lose its nerve and break, which would usually end hoplite battles (the pursuer can\\'t pursue very fast without breaking ranks and becoming vulnerable to a counterattack).  It\\'s thus very important to train people to maintain formation.  (Side note: many battles would end in a matter of minutes because one side would run away when charged, even before the enemies reached them--this happened often to Xenophon and the Greek mercenaries he was with in the Anabasis, where they win some \\'battles\\' without even touching the Persians). \\n This becomes more important when one is fighting against cavalry, who are both terrifying and can pursue you (and will always catch you) if you break.  However, when you are disciplined and have spears/pikes, it is very easy to beat charging cavalry--provided you don\\'t break.  All you have to do is sit there, confident that no one on your side is going to run away. \\n Basic spear training then would probably be mostly maneuvering around to make sure that you could move without breaking formation, as well as some sort of training for actual combat (I believe Spartans would line up in the traditional 8 ranks deep an try to push down trees, but I can\\'t remember where I read that and I feel it may be from a novel).  The key to all of this is to build unit cohesion and discipline and make it so that people wouldn\\'t run away/break formation.  This is going to be just as much psychological training as it is skill based training, because you need to feel like a part of the unit and not worry that as soon as the enemy comes your \"buddies\" will run away. \\n The thing about all that I said above is that it makes your spearmen good at taking a charge, but not that great at attacking; only truly elite units like the Spartans, Swiss Pikes, etc could be tactically offensive troops.  This was what a lot of their training was.  After the fall of the Western Roman Empire (5th c.), there were no heavy infantry units that could be tactically offensive until the Swiss, although there were infantry units that could (and did) successfully defend against cavalry charges.  The Swiss though could attack, and since they were in big squares could attack or defend in more than one direction (Spartan hoplites can only go forward) \\n So this went on longer than I expected, and basically boils down to: \\n TL;DR the training to stab with a spear is easy, it takes a lot more to be able to fight in formation without breaking ranks (a lot is psychological), but what made the truly elite units elite (and what took up most of their training) was being able to maintain the above cohesion while moving toward the enemy and thus be able to attack. \\n SOURCES: mostly Archer Jones\\' \"The Art of War in the Western World\" \\n',\n  0),\n (\"Well, in the US, a large subset of the population was ethnically German (about 15% in the 2000 census identified as German).

Social movements is a GIANT subfield within sociology, but there\\'s no \"Sociologist\\'s guide to being a successful activist!\" though there are several books a decade about new theories of social movements.

The Macedonians, and the Thracians, shared a number of cultural similarities to the Greeks, but were considered \"backwards\" and \"uncultured\" by mainstream Greeks. The Macedonians (and Thracians) were more rural and \"uncultured\" than the major Greek city-states, and even after their conquest by Philip, most \"Greeks\" were dismissive of Macedonians. The Greek desire for \"independence\" was thus capitalized on by pretty much every single successor state, as everyone from Ptolemy to Demetrius (\"The Besieger\", which is honestly one of my favorite nicknames of antiquity. I mean, how badass does \"Demetrius the Besieger\" sound? Super badass, that\\'s how much), took advantage of the Greek desire for autonomy to try to weaken central control, and get the Greeks to rebel against whoever happened to control them at that period in time. \\n TL:DR Greeks, Macedonians, and even Thracians shared some cultural background...but the Greeks still hated everyone who wasn\\'t \"Greek\" enough to them, and they hated central/federal control even more. \\n',\n  0),\n ('It\\'s hard to prove a negative, but I\\'ve never actually found evidence of an actual hunting license, in the sense that the license holder was allowed to shoot a certain number of indigenous people per year, as the legend goes.

The main theory nowadays is that a large drought completely destroyed the Harappan civilization, and caused it to degenerate into a less developed society called the Ochre colored pottery culture. \\n This culture was the main one present when the Aryans were heavily colonizing the Indus, and this culture combined with other local cultures and the Rigvedic Aryan civilization produced what we know as Vedic civilization. The main evidence of this merging is both archeological, in the form of new artwork and remains, and literary. The Rigveda(the oldest Veda that's dates back to the original Vedic migrations)mentions both the un-cremated forefathers, or ánagnidagdha(the pre-Aryan Harappas) and the new Aryan cremated dead, or agnidagdhá.

In the beginning of September the Germans were on the outskirts of Paris in the force of the 1st and 2nd Armies who were at roughly half strength each. Instead of going for a protracted siege of a city which they believed to be empty they continued pursuit of the French army in \"full rout\" for their \"mini cannae.\" You\\'ll see in [this map here]( of the Battle on the Marne the catastrophe that would take place. Paris was not empty and not deemed strategically unimportant by the French and was actually filled with a massive garrison for a predicted siege. Instead the 1st and 2nd Armies both gave the garrison their backs in pursuit of the \"routed\" army. Kluck\\'s First Army would have to wheel back around to meet the garrison force pouring out of the city. He,  while subordinate to Bulow , did not just zag away to meet the force and create a massive gap he would  steal 2 corps from Bulow\\'s army before confirming it was okay to help with his assault and thus exposed Bulow further.  Bulow exacerbated the situation by shifting  his entire army  to his left, widening the gap further. \\n So basically Kluck reoriented at the expense of Bulow to stop his army from being flanked and to push the attack at Ourcq. However with that said I don\\'t think it was ultimately Kluck\\'s fault. No matter what he did the Germans were fucked at this point. At the start of the war they had a 2:1 advantage of artillery over the French and by the Marne the tables had turned in that regard -- the French had the 2:1 artillery advantage. I truly believe Kluck believed that aggression was the only way to salvage the situation as sitting back and making contact with Bulow would have lead to a flank or spreading the line thin enough to meet the encroaching French would have led to an inevitable breakthrough and collapse of the German forces even more drastically. I put the blame completely and utterly on Helmuth von Moltke, Chief of Staff of the German Army. I think /u/BeyondtheGrave put it best in a post he made last month: \\n > Moltke was indecisive, and unwilling to issue orders to his subordinate commanders (some of whom were German royalty). Moltke was to act in a role later defined as an \"Army Group Commander\", that is, his job was to keep the multiple armies all on the same track. He was supposed to be the guy with a clear head, who, armed with up-to-date information, would say \"You go here, you stay put, you push now, you pull back\". But this never happened. As early as mid-August, Moltke had repeated allowed his army commanders to fight battles as they pleased. Against his better judgement (and repeated \"requests\" to stay put), he allowed the Armies in the south to push forward, eventually letting them smash themselves against the fortified line between Verdun and Nancy, and the Swiss border. That cost precious lives, stretched those armies out, committed valuable reserves to a hopeless cause, and it pushed the French onto a well developed rail line which allowed them to drain the southern front of troops. It also set the precedent that Moltke would allow his subordinates to do as they thought proper, not as the commander wanted. \\n On the eve of the Marne Moltke would be totally cut off from the 1st Army and would only have one radio in contact with Bulow\\'s 2nd. Moltke, to make decisions in this critical war defining moment, needed to get an assessment of the situation and work out the differences between Kluck and Bulow. He needed an up to date status report of both armies, their conditions, and how combat ready they were. He needed, in short, to know what was going on. So he sent Lt. Colonel Hentsch to investigate the matter. Let me repeat that in bold letters:  While Joseph Joffre, Commander of the French Army, personally drove across the front in a freaking race car to personally check on his generals and to make sure his orders were carried out in completeness Moltke put the entire war effort in the hands of a Lieutenant Colonel.  Hentsch would see Bulow going into nothing short of shock and a breakdown about the dire situation.  Only meeting with Bulow and being filled with the same panicked fear Hentsch, with the full authority granted to him would order the 2nd Armies retreat without even checking in on Kluck.  This would, obviously, force Kluck to retreat as well and thus sending the 1st and 2nd Armies into full rout. \\n Ultimately the Germans lost because Moltke was an incompetent leader and was everything his father was not. He was cautious, timid, and wanted to play games. He was in many ways an armchair general who wanted to look at a map and point at a city and say \"go there\" and his big bad army goes there and destroys it. Instead of setting up a sophisticated command hierarchy of intermediary powers and communications he wanted to run it all by himself. Everything. From the North Sea to the Swiss Alps and to the men in East Prussia, Moltke wanted to run it all. This would not necessarily be an issue if he had any backbone and did not consistently sap his own authority. He let his officers run free. We can\\'t necessarily blame those officers because they had no guidance. What were they to do when they weren\\'t being told anything and their commander was making absolutely no effort to maintain contact with them? \\n TL;DR:  Horrendous communications, massive casualties at the expense of constant attacks, competent Generals made incompetent in the face of an impotent commander who refused to  actually do anything , an overly rigid plan based entirely on idealism and strokes of luck, this strange mix between refusal to deviate from the plan while constantly changing it. By that I mean, Moltke still expected to win in 40 days despite reducing that ratio from 7:1 to 3:1 thus drastically reducing his offensive capacity. Moltke still pushed his men in that over extensive fashion while still funneling troops to men like Crown Prince Rupprecht. It\\'s completely contradictory thought and it just bled the Germans dry. They had no cohesiveness, basically. It was a strong army but without any strong leadership or without a command structure or communications infrastructure to run it. \\n \\n Notes: \\n The Marne: The Opening of the First World War , Holger Herwig \\n The First World War: Germany and Austria Hungary 1914-1918 , Holger Herwig \\n',\n  0),\n ('It really depends on what you mean by \"crazy\" and who among Rome\\'s chroniclers you serve to believe. \\n It\\'s unequivocally clear from the historical record that Nero was debauched narcissist who didn\\'t feel himself bound by the conventional morality of his day. This was was a man who, after all, traveled through the empire participating as the prime contestant in musical festivals which he ordered to be held; castrated a  man  \"married\" him and dressed him as the emperess, and made him his wife; and, after the Great Fire of Rome, had made a [massive bronze statute]( of himself nearly as tall as the Statue of Liberty  at the smallest . \\n What isn\\'t so clear now is whether Nero was was simply perverse but also measured in his excesses and acting with genuine concern in his governance of the empire(as Pliny and Tacitus depicted him and how he is now generally viewed) , or completely without conscience and unhinged (as writers like Suetonius, Dio Cassius, and Sextus Aurelius Victor portray him). \\n [For instance:](\\n>In the year 64 A.D., a devastating fire occurred in Rome. The Emperor, who was at Antium, on learning of the conflagration, returned to the city and undertook relief measures. He threw open his gardens and public buildings to the dispossessed populace and brought in grain from the neighboring towns. But, according to  Tacitus , \"his measures, popular as their character might be, failed of their effect; for the report had spread that, at the very moment when Rome was aflame, he had mounted his private stage, and, typifying the ills of the present by the calamities of the past, had sung the Destruction of Troy.\" \\n > Suetonius , writing at almost the same time, tells the story as if it were a fact, changing the details as follows: \"Viewing the conflagration from the tower of Maecenas . . . he sang the whole of the Sack of Ilion in his regular stage costume.\" \\n Reading Tacitus and Pliny we see a man who, loved his wife greatly and mourned her heavily after her death; personally led the relief of Rome after it\\'s Great Fire and dedicated much time and effort to it\\'s reconstruction afterwards;and took much interest in Rome\\'s war with Parthia and with putting down of revolts (inc. one which resulted in the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem). We see a man who, though perverse, was capable of feeling genuine love and felt a desire to govern well. \\n Compare this to the completeness of what  Sextus Aurelius Victor  says of him in the [Epitome De Caesaribus]( \\n >Domitius Nero, scion of Domitius Ahenobarbus, his father, and Agrippina, his mother, ruled thirteen years. 2. For five years he seemed bearable, whence some have reported that Trajan was accustomed to say that the principes as a group were far different than Nero -- for a five-year period. 3. In the city, he constructed an amphitheater and baths. 4. Pontus he reduced to the status of a province with the permission of King Polemo, from whom Pontus Polemoniacus is named, as likewise the Cottian Alps from the dead King Cottius. 5. For indeed he passed the remainder of his life shamelessly, so that it is embarrassing to commemorate any of this. He went so far that, sparing neither his own decency nor that of others, at last, veiled in the manner of a bride-to-be, [140] with dowry paid, with everyone crowding together in festive fashion, he was married in the presence of the senate. Covered with the skin of a wild animal, he used to forage the sexual organs of either sex with his face. He even contaminated with defilement his own mother, whom he afterward killed. After their husbands were slain, he married Octavia and the Sabina with the cognomen Poppaea. 6. Then Galba, proconsul of Hispania, and Gaius Julius usurped imperium. 7. When Nero learned that Galba approached and that the senate had resolved that, according to ancestral custom, when his neck had been thrust into a yoke, he was to be beaten to death with rods, he, completely deserted, left the city in the middle of the night with Phaon, Epaphroditus and Neophytus, and the eunuch Sporus, whom once, after he had been castrated, he had tried to transform into a woman; and he pierced himself with a blow of his sword, with the impure eunuch about whom we spoke aiding his trembling hand while, since no one had been found earlier by whom he might be struck, he soberly exclaimed: \"So, do I have neither friend nor foe? I lived shamelessly, let me die shamefully.\" 8. He perished in the thirty-second year of his life. The Persians had been so delighted with him that they sent legations furnishing materials for constructing a monument. 9. Otherwise the provinces as a whole and all Rome exulted in his death to such a degree that the urban masses donned the caps of freedmen and celebrated manumission, as if they had been delivered from a savage dominus. \\n TL/DR - Nero was \"hold music festivals in his own honor and marry, as \"empress\" a man he had castrated crazy\" but probably  not \"screw his own mother, stomp to death his pregnant wife and sing while Rome burns\" crazy. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Another aspect to this: \\n According to Wilhelm Reich, author of \"The Mass Psychology of Fascism\" both Nazism & Communism had appeal among the masses, both ideologies forms of Fascism (Communism = \"Red\" Fascism). \\n Upon the coming into power by the Nazis and their eradication of both Communist & Socialist parties, it would have been a minor shift of belief and loyalty to Nazism, as all of the above demand self-repression & subservience from the masses.

I would not say that Mendelssohn rediscovered Bach\\'s music, I would say he helped reviving it. Bach\\'s works weren\\'t completely lost, they circulated in private copies and were some times played. I think these works mostly circulated among \"music geeks,\" but they still were around. \\n Mozart knew of Bach, and admired his works. Christian Gottlob Neefe, one of Beethoven\\'s teachers, was involved in the Simrock edition of the WTC. He had Beethoven studying the WTC, and Beethoven later recommended it as a great thing for musicians to study (both for technical skill in the keyboard and to see great compositional skills in action). Bach had very talented sons (they were pretty well known during their lives), and some knowledgeable students, who kept copies/originals of some of his works and to some extent kept his music alive. Gottfried van Swieten was a patron of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. He was a student of Kirnberger, who might have been a student of Bach (or maybe not, but in any case he was a big, big fan of Bach\\'s music). Van Swieten was pretty knowledgeable about music, and Bach\\'s was at least some times played/discussed because of him. \\n Bach\\'s sons and students then had patrons, friends and their own students. Music geeks come in contact with other music geeks, and train new music geeks... Mendelssohn and others in his circle had came in contact with Bach\\'s music in this way. Mendelssohn was not the first to want to try to organize a big performance of Bach music, but he was able to make it big. \\n The Mendelssohn\\'s were doing well, Felix was a very talented musician and made a reputation for himself.

At the time, it was fashionable to know about old and obscure things (kind of a hipstery thing) and the German speaking world was trying to create some kind of unity.

They needed to knock out the US navy while they still could, in a effort to buy themselves time. The early (and secret!) plan was roughly as follows: \\n >1. The attack must catch the enemy completely by surprise.\\n>1. The main objective of the attack should be US carriers.\\n>1. Another priority target should be US land-based planes on Oahu.\\n>1. Every available carrier should participate in the operation.\\n>1. The attack should utilize all types of bombing - torpedo, dive, and high-level.\\n>1.

The telegram was delayed; they began the attack \"believing that Kichisaburo Nomura, the Japanese Ambassador in Washington, had already handed the US government a declaration of war. However, Nomura handed Hull the declaration 50 minutes after the operation had begun, which meant the attack was in violation of international law, and was characterized as a \\'sneak attack\\' in the US.\" The reason for the delay was a lack of communication with the embassy office (they didn\\'t know the priority of the messages being decoded), and the message was sent in 14 parts. \\n If they had properly communicated with the embassy office, and ensured that the declaration of war preceded the attack, then Pearl Harbor would be seen  completely  differently by Western histories. \\n TL;DR:  Japan had no choice: they had to knock out the US navy while they still could, before the US switched to full military production.

It's a fairly vague question, and covers a lot.  There are fairly obvious ones, such as people in the ghettos and camps coordinating resistance.  Good examples are the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, the escape from Sobibor, and the escape from Treblinka.  The former was organized partly by Jewish resistance organizations. \\n But I assume you're talking about Jews outside the rule of the Nazis helping Jews under the control of the Germans.  For the most part, there wasn't a whole lot Jews could do.  In general, they lived in countries at war with Germany anyway, and the Jewish community didn't have quite the influence they have today--they were actually concerned with being seen as having too much influence, since that would foster conspiracy theories. \\n The good examples are from British Mandatory Palestine.  Prior to the war, a number of Jewish groups had been fighting the British over the terms of the mandate.  The primary issue was that Jewish immigration was restricted when huge numbers of Jews needed somewhere to go during the rise of Nazism because of Arab pressure.  This resulted in a concerted effort by Jewish groups to smuggle in Jewish immigrants, and generally ignore British government.  The attempts at getting Jews out of Nazi Germany is an example of this on its own.  Jews at the time in Germany really didn't have anywhere to go legally, so illegal immigration to Palestine was a viable option, and the only one for many. \\n Despite the fact that the restrictions on immigration (which essentially kept Jews from leaving Germany legally, and hardened anti-British sentiment) happened just before the war began (and continued as a civil war pretty much immediately after it), Jewish groups suspended their anti-British campaigns and joined the British.  The most notable example was the [Jewish Brigade]( a group of 5,000 Jews from Mandatory Palestine who joined the British Army in a special unit.  Some German Jews served in an intellegence capacity, such as [these guys](  Many of them were fluent in German and had lived in Germany for significant portions of their lives, but could still be depended on by the Allies to not be double-agents.  Note that members of those organizations were sometimes recruited straight from Jewish organizations resisting the British.  A number also were paratroopers sent by the British into Hungary, trying to prevent Jews from being sent to camps.  The most well-known of these is Hannah Senesh, who was captured and executed but is also noted for her poems. \\n tl;dr There wasn't a whole lot Jews in most places could do.  Jews in mandatory Palestine coordinated attempts to have Jews immigrate to Palestine, and stopped fighting the British and joined them for the duration of the war. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('I\\'m going to assume that you mean the schism of 1054? \\n East and West had been on divergent courses for centuries. A major problem here was a general lack of comprehension; few in the East spoke Latin, and virtually no one in the West spoke Greek, except for some pockets of Southern Italy. Further complicating matters is that Greek is a fluid, subtle language, while Latin is much more legalistic. As such, completely different theological controversies popped up in the east versus the west. There were differences in the practices of Eastern and Western Christianity nearly from the outset; they just didn\\'t cause problems until much later. \\n Problems really started to pop up in the 8th century. Byzantium had lost the vast majority of its Western holdings, excepting Illyricum and Sicily. Each of these areas had traditionally been under the purview of the papacy, but the emperor decided to transfer jurisdiction to the patriarch of Constantinople. This made the patriarch\\'s jurisdiction equivalent to the borders of the empire, a fairly logical arrangement. Obviously, however, the papacy wasn\\'t happy about such lessening of its authority, particularly since the Bishop of Rome had been considered to be the  primus inter pares  of the five patriarchs since antiquity. This is likely one of the reasons Rome turned to Charlemagne and the Carolingians at this time. Historically Rome had been the ally of Byzantium, but it had been jilted one too many times. Contrary to popular belief, iconoclasm most likely had absolutely nothing to do with this; in fact, iconoclasm may very well have not even been a thing. For more on this, see the books on the topic by Leslie Brubaker and John Haldon. \\n Next up was the Photian Schism, in the 9th century. The papacy was becoming more vocal about it\\'s right to supremacy as the successor to St. Peter, at least in part due to the \"redistricting\" described above. The theological differences also started to come to light at this time. Among these were the issues of clerical celibacy, the azymes (whether to use leavened or unleavened bread during the Mass), papal primacy, and most famously, the filioque. The gist of the filioque: At some point (it\\'s unclear precisely when), the Latin word \"filioque\" was added to the Nicene Creed. The word means \"and from the son,\" and it refers to the procession of the Holy Spirit. It seems that this was a particularly popular addition in Frankish circles, and as their influence in Rome grew, this word was added to the Creed. Generally speaking, this was not an explicit problem for the Eastern Church. They saw it as an exegetical tool used to make up for the lack of intricacy of the Latin language. As long as the Latins weren\\'t forcing it on others, there was really no reason to be upset. Patriarch Photios felt differently, and saw the filioque as a dangerous and innovative change to a document produced by an ecumenical council (the absolute highest authority in the Eastern Church). This is the first time these theological issues are being seriously debated by the leaders of these two Churches and, although the schism was healed, the stage was set. \\n Fast Forward to 1054. The papacy sent its legate, Cardinal Humbert, to Constantinople to assert its claims of primacy over the patriarchate, citing the Donation of Constantine (proven to be a forgery by Lorenzo Valla in the 15th century). Humbert and Patriarch Keroularios exchange letters over this and other issues but, thanks to sloppy translation work on both sides, each side came to be deeply offended. Events culminated with Humbert and the rest of the delegation marching into Hagia Sophia during the Liturgy and presenting a papal bull of excommunication, signifying a formal split between the Latins and Greeks. The legation walked out of the cathedral ( easily  the largest church in the world at the time, built by Justinian in the 6th century. Not the point here, but a fun fact), symbolically shaking the dust from their shoes as they left. Keroularios was shocked and outraged, and responded with his own excommunication of the pope. And thus the schism was born. \\n This is the traditional view, but how you define a formal cessation of relations between the Churches is sticky. Traditionally the Churches honored the other patriarchs on diptychs, signifying that those patriarchs were being prayed for by the other Churches. This practice seems to have stopped earlier in the 11th century; does that mean that the schism started then? After Keroularios was no longer the Patriarch, tensions between Constantinople and the Papacy eased; how can that be explained? Personally, I am of the opinion that, were it not for the Fourth Crusade, the two Churches would likely still be in communion with one another to this day--although the modern world would look so drastically different this is pure speculation. It\\'s only after 1204 that things crystallize to the point that there was no going back. \\n I hope that this helps! \\n TL/DR: East and West were on divergent courses from the outset, but things start to ramp up in the 8th century.The events of 1054 are largely the product of the differences between Greek and Latin, both in the languages themselves and the sloppy translation work of 11th century clerics. However, it\\'s not clear that 1054 is an important date without the benefit of hindsight. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"I don’t have access to much in the way of scholarly articles and I’m not particularly good at this, but here is a simple answer to a complex question: \\n The handful of states you are referring to were members of the Holy Roman Empire, a political entity that can have a WHOLE lot said about it. In short, it basically encompassed the various feudal lords of central europe into a kind of confederation or at least a sort of shared sense of identity. Most of these HRE (Holy Roman Empire) states were culturally German, and the people considered themselves to be Germans. There are a lot of different ways people identify themselves - American, Texan, European, Italian, etc. - and the importance one places in that identification varies. Most of these “German” people probably thought of themselves more in terms of where they were from in terms of their towns or counties, and in terms of who their lord was. \\n Germany was wracked by horrific wars in the 17th century, went through a radical shift as Protestant religions began altering the confessional landscape of the region through the 16th - 18th centuries, suffered humiliating (for their own pride) defeats at the hands of Napolean, and began to feel threatened by more centralized states like the British, Russia, and of course France. Again, there’s a WHOLE lot to be said about this time, but the short of it is that other states around Germany were turning into modern states - that is, the middle class was identifying itself as members of a political identity with geographical borders and they didn’t see the old feudal lords as the apex of the new world order - and so German peoples began agitating for a state of their own encompassing much of the old HRE, that is, the culturally German people. \\n Prussia and Austria were major players in the German HRE, and both considered themselves natural leaders of the German people, and had different ideas for how Germany should form. Remember, these states are essentially dynasties, so that means they are lead by families and run kind of like a mix between a country and a corporation. They competed for influence amongst the other states, and on the world scene. \\n In 1848 a series of revolutions swept through the German territories, and though there is more to these revolutions, they were also in large part revolutions of the middle and lower classes demanding constitutions and the creation of something much closer to our modern states. The next twenty years saw a lot of wheeling and dealing between the various dynasties and competition between Austria and Prussia, but eventually, Prussia (a country very famous for its military and bureaucracy at the time) won a war against France and in the palace at Versailles, as part of the peace settlement, proclaimed the Prussian king to be the German Emperor. There was a great deal of support amongst the German populace for this, as well as some opposition (mostly in southern Germany), and international recognition of this move. A state really is just what people say it is, so having your neighbors acknowledge you is really important. \\n Edit: To note, Germany was formed WITHOUT Austria. \\n Up until WWI the German Nation was ruled as a constitutional monarchy, similar to how Britain is ruled, with power increasingly going from the Monarch towards the parliament, though the Prussian monarch maintained control of the armed forces. \\n Again, there's SO much more to be said about the formation of Germany and I oversimplified some things. But hope this gives you a place to start. \\n The larger states involved in the unification of Germany process: \\nDuchies and Principalities are pretty small, and to my knowledge, not terribly important political players. They mattered, but not a whole lot individually. \\n TLDR; People in modern day Germany already called themselves Germans, they felt threatened by the power of outside states, growing middle class and lower class political conscious led to people wanting democratic reform, and so they made a state and called it Germany. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('Okay, so I\\'m gonna hit a big nono here that I\\'m gonna get stabbed for. However! Everyone knows what I mean when I say Dark Ages - it\\'s the period between the fall of Rome and the Rise of the HRE. Generally. So if I say Dark Ages, it\\'s somewhere between 400-800 AD Europe. Don\\'t hurt me ;D \\n First example! The monastery at San Vincenzo, which was built in (apparently) 731, about 250 or so years after the fall of the Roman Empire. There was a decision made early on to make it a hierarchical construction - something that would last - so the design was carefully planned out. Emphasis was given to asymmetrical spaces, one entered from the other. Quoting from  Light in the Dark Ages: the rise and fall of San Vincenzo al Volturno : \\n >  This arrangement was reinforced by a hierarchy of building styles: timber buildings, pise (cob) buildings, buildings with poorly mortared walls, and buildings containing conspicuously-placed  spoila  robbed from antique buildings - marble blocks, ashlar and mouldings. The use of  spolia  as design features within the buildings was also an important factor in the evolution of the new monastery. This involved many tons of extremely heavy Roman pieces being located and brought to San Vincenzo. (Of course, this was not especially remarkable in Carolingian Europe: marbles plundered from Rome were taken as far north as the monastery of Centula overlooking the English Channel, and to the palace of Ingelheim in the Rhineland.) \\n Needless to say, that quote says a ton all by itself! The people in the early and high Middle Ages saw the Roman architecture as magnificent, built by veritable giants. However, they also saw it as a ready and very handy source of free building material. More from that same book: \\n > The church was 35 paces long, 15 wide and 12 high (to the roof beams). Inside were 36 columns taken from a Roman temple in the vicinity of Capua. \\n ([Here]( is a quick reference to distance there, for the lazy. A is the monastery, B is Capua. Back then, transporting that much marble over 60+ miles of uncertain terrain was one HELL of an achievement and must have been expensive as hell. Just using this to show EXACTLY how much the Roman ruins were prized as \"FREE BUILDING MATERIAL THAT LOOKS PRETTY HERE.\" So we have a definite answer that the CHURCHES certainly used a whole lot of Roman stonework. \\n Then, for the layfolk! We have evidence (taking this from  The Bishop\\'s Palace: Architecture and Authority in Medieval Italy  here) that simple houses were built over the old Roman forum in Liguria in the sixth century (Less than a hundred years after the fall of Rome.) They\\'ve found seventh century huts of clay and wood that used the remains of Roman walls as their supports, and hundreds of other instances of...for lack of a better term, ancient squatting among the roman ruins, that show how people clung to the former glories of Rome. The remains of Roman structures were subdivided with wooden partitions into tiny apartments. I\\'ll go ahead and steal another quote here for reference. \\n > A rough heirarchy of possibilities, however, is discernible: at the low end, small structures of wood or clay incorporating the ruins of Roman buildings; somewhere in the middle, one-level ( pedeplana ) stone structures; at the high end, two-story stone structures with some functional articulation of space. \\n Just so you have an idea how these people lived. Walls were made of uncut stone and mortar or of recycled Roman  spolia , floors and internal divisions were often wood, and roofs were wooden shingles or clay tiles. Elite lay residences (villas) obviously would have been more elaborate, and they\\'re often  veeeeerry  similar to episcopal residences. What a COINCIDENCE ;) \\n TL;DR  - They stole a lot. \\n',\n  0),\n ('I\\'ll give you the conventional story first. Agriculture was invented and spread for \"systemic\" reasons, i.e. it supported larger populations and that allowed those populations (or at least their practices) to spread at the expense of smaller forager ones, not necessarily because individual people preferred agriculture to foraging. In the first few millennia after the adoption of agriculture people\\'s health declined because instead of eating a highly varied diet of wild foods and game they were now almost exclusively relying on a few high-calorie, low-nutrient grains. So even though they were getting enough to eat and then some – enough to fuel millennia of sustained population growth – they were technically malnourished: their diet lacked all sorts of micronutrients and was possibly also protein-deficient, leading to health problems. We can sometimes see this in ancient skeletons, where after adopting farming they get shorter and show more pathologies. Eventually this situation improved as mixed farming technology did, but as you suggested living at high population densities has a whole raft of other health implications in terms of zoonotic diseases, greater risk of infection, etc. Beyond health, quality of life would also have declined as people had to work harder and longer to feed themselves, and in time even harder still to feed themselves  and  various parasitic elites (kings, priests, historians, etc.) You can also blame agriculture indirectly for things like increased violence and greater social inequality which also seem to be a consequence of settled living and population density. \\n Jared Diamond wrote [a great little article on this conventional view]( back in the 80s. \\n Now I\\'ll tell you why I\\'m not entirely convinced by the conventional story. To start with, a lot of its based on \"well it must have happened way\" extrapolation from an old dogma that the invention of agriculture inevitably led to settled living which inevitably led to civilisation – we domesticated plants, then they domesticated us. It\\'s not very empirical. The skeletal evidence for health problems, for example, is there, but it isn\\'t exactly compelling. Recently our understandings of the origins of agriculture (in Eurasia) has changed a lot, and we know now that its \"invention\" was actually a  very  long period of transition which involved a complex feedback relationship between settled living and various food-producing techniques. To cut a long story short, it\\'s no longer clear that agricultural lifestyles were forced on us by systemic factors like population growth or climate change or whatever – at some point there must have been a reason why people wanted to live that way. The undermines the idea that it could have really been that immediately detrimental to people\\'s health and quality of life, or that we can blame agriculture for the later ills of \"civilisation\" any more than we can blame any other development in our species\\' long cultural evolution. At the same time, we\\'ve found that early agricultural societies perhaps weren\\'t as reliant on crops alone as previously thought, and that wild foods remained an important component of people\\'s diets for many thousands of years after they supposedly went through their \"agricultural revolution\". \\n I found a  good summary of these new perspectives here \\n tl;dr:  your textbook is out of date. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"That is not exactly it.  You are correct that slavery was a big issue that helped to undermine support for the war in the northern states.  Many people certainly worried that much of the territory (Texas primarily) would eventually become slave territory and that adding slave states would upset the balance between slave and free states in the Senate.  Andrew Jackson was in this camp, as was Martin van Buren. \\n But the Missouri Compromise did not dictate that the new territory would be for slavery.  The Missouri Compromise only legally applied to the Louisiana Purchase, and so the land won from Mexico was not governed by its dictates.  All of it could have been slave or free (excluding Texas).  Hence we get efforts, like the Wilmot Proviso, to answer the question of the land's status. \\n tl/dr:  It did reopen the question of slavery, but did not involve the Missouri Compromise in a legal sense. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('When the US still had a frontier to the West, the people who headed out to seek their fortune were usually men.  They outnumbered women by a significant margin.  Many were unmarried.  Many had trouble back East that they were running from. \\n Normal women jobs were taken over by men.  Y\\'know Chinese laundry?  That began in the mid-1800\\'s when Chinese immigrants saw a serious lack of women meaning a great need for laundry services.  You\\'ll find that in the West, it was not uncommon for white men to marry Maxican or Native women. \\n Back to the point.  On the frontier, few wives and hardly any unmarried women.  So prostitution was a solution.  Women would be hired out East and shipped to a Western town where a job was waiting for them.  Some of those women eventually got married, some saved up and opened their own brothels. \\n Eventually, \"civilization\" caught up.  Now, prostitution was always in the East, but it wasn\\'t exactly considered a necessary pillar of the community.  The suffragettes weren\\'t just about getting women the vote.  They also took on many issues that they felt were in the best interest of women.  A majority of suffragettes were upper-class white women because they had the time and resources to devote themselves to things like social justice issues. \\n These well-to-do ladies were often puritans.  They had a problem with alcohol, in large part because they believed it led to domestic violence.  They had a problem with gambling, because some husbands would blow their week\\'s paycheck at a card game and not have anything for her and the kids. \\n It should be no surprise that they also were not fans of prostitution.  Some were unkind to prostitutes, many just wanted to save those women from prostitution.  They thought of prostitution as a form of slavery, that the women were passive victims.  This view was not held only by the feminists of the day but by many men as well.  Also, parallel to prostitution is birth control, necessarily, which has its own ethical and religious arguments attached. \\n These women had influence even before they could vote.  After all, they talked their husbands in to letting them vote in 1920.  Part of that was that they believed the alleged moral superiority of women would have a cleansing effect on politics. \\n Science progressed, and awareness and understanding of venereal diseases improved.  Much of the early banning of prostitution came out of a fear for public health.  Prostitutes spread diseases, men bring them home to their wives, etc.  There was concern that soldiers would pick up diseases and lose their fighting ability. \\n it wasn\\'t all banned in one day.  Prostitute immigrants were banned by the feds in the late 1800s.  Then there were ordinances to tuck it away where people couldn\\'t see.  Laws that did things like prohibit brothels to operate on the ground floor of a building. \\n But what really pushed it over the edge was a  \"white prostitution\"  \"white slavery\" scare in the early 1900\\'s.  Turns out to be mostly untrue.  At the time, it was seen as a national crisis.  If you are old enough to remember the \"crack epidemic\" of the 80\\'s, you\\'ll have some idea.  Prostitution was often banned outright to save innocent women from being kidnapped, drugged, raped, and enslaved by swarthy, dark-hued foreigners and rapists. \\n As an aside, the growing socialist movement in the US believed that prostitution was representative of \"capitalist exploitation\". \\n tl;dr \\n A lot of factors added up:  The end of the practical necesseity in the west, female involvement in politics, religious distaste for birth control and vice, a practical fear of disease, and a declining confidence in capitalism. \\n It wasn\\'t gone in one day.

They were certainly familiar with sepsis (it was probably a common way to die), and understood some specific cases of its cause (dirty bandages, water). \\n For example, ancients understood that cauterizing a wound both closed it, and avoided infection -- they just didn't understand that the glowing iron from a fire killed microorganisms. Slapping hot iron to an arrow or spear wound is a common enough trope. \\n tl;dr They understood the results of sepsis, and some specific anecdotal causes, but not the actual underlying causes that lead us to the development of anti-septic practices. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('Your analysis is flawed. I\\'ll try to be brief. I apologize for being contrary. \\n >Generally, the key problem with these assertions is that the Irish who were brought to America as labourers were indentured servants, rather than slaves. That means that they were bound by contract to labour for a set amount of time, after which they would be free. \\n We cannot call someone who is  sentenced  to a period of involuntary servitude against their will, and especially because their crime was \"Being in Oliver Cromwell\\'s way\",  or for or any other reason,  as being a legitimate signatory to contract. A contract is made by two parties and is considered legally binding now, and in the periods we are talking about, when both parties enter into it of their own free will. One has a contract to fulfil, the other a sentence. \\n Being sentenced to a period of servitude where you are neither free to leave, to refuse, to conduct commerce, to marry, to reproduce, and all done against your will, is not the same, as entering into a contract of your own free will where you temporarily sign away those rights in the hopes of surviving the term and collecting a reward. That’s a huge distinction there that your analysis is missing. \\n The fact that it was \\n >… not at all unusual for people (Irish, African, or otherwise) to be forced to work against their will or to work under horrific conditions during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. \\n doesn\\'t actually ameliorate the misery that those people would have felt, or the injustice that they or  anyone else  who was bound to servitude against their will would been subjected to. \\n >If you want to call everyone who was forced to work against their will, or who was treated poorly as a worker, a \"slave\" then you\\'re broadening the category of \"slave\" to the point where it becomes almost useless as a descriptor. \\n This is true, it  is  useless as a specific descriptor.  Exactly because it’s a single word broad descriptor. It’s only more a specific descriptor in Pop history in the United States because American Pop history often ignores the existence of the rest of the world. In the US the American Civil War is the only Civil War, thus its title, The Civil War. Slavery in the US means slavery in the Antebellum South. \\n Except Slavery  is  a broad term. People who are bound to servitude, and restricted in their freedom who are forced to work for someone else\\'s benefit, were and are called: slave labour, forced labour, prison labour or a host of other terms - A thing so odious that it is mostly outlawed from a legitimate wartime or peacetime practice. \\n Historically to refer to the condition of racialized chattel slavery in the American South leading up to the US Civil War, requires those additional descriptors “racialized”, “chattel” “In the American South.”. You want to use the very broad term \"slavery\" to mean only the following specifically. \\n >But we can acknowledge that without using the term \"slave\" - which in this particular historical context has a very specific meaning: it refers to Africans who were subjected to forceful, life-long, back-breaking, and racialized slavery. \\n That is firstly contradicted in your own argument as: \\n > In the Caribbean and American colonies, people were still puzzling out what it meant to be a \"servant,\" a \"slave,\" or a \"master.\" There\\'s this whole long, fascinating process by which people in the American colonies appear to have decided that \"slaves\" were black and everyone else was free. \\n Indeed. So in developmental time period in the 17th century, the definition was not stratified, such as the decision of 1662 that a child of Free man and a slave woman would take the mother’s status in contravention to English law which had ruled heretofore? A distinction must be made pre and post this law, and then again when the law in Virginia is tightened in 1705. If you admit that there is a process by which all servants are eventually differentiated into slave and servant, and that it also classified by race, a concept that  did  not  exist until it was codified as part of that process, what historical basis can you have for wanting to restrict the definition to that which was used after that codification? Your definition wouldn\\'t match the period you are describing because the terms hadn\\'t been yet developed in the way you are using them.  And to compare the Irish in 1653 to Chattel from 100 years later, has no legitimacy, you must compare contemporaneus captives and their conditions, terms, and identified labels. \\n Slavery refers to people being bound over to service to another against their will. It  is  absolutely a broad term. During the period you are talking about there was and had been “slavery” in other parts of the world, North Africa, or China, for example, where slaves had it from bad to worse, but their conditions do not match the conditions of which you speak. Were they not slaves? Calling those slaves, slaves is neither incorrect, not revisionist. \\n Furthermore prior to the Anglo-American Virginia codifications, there were black servants who were set free. The laws to prevent blacks from gaining freedom and using it, to prevent half breeds from being born free were written as a reaction to this. And in the 1705 Virginia law, the law was then used to confiscate property from freed blacks. \\n Racialized chattel slavery in the 18th and 19th century American South is a mouthful, but if that’s what is being discussed, that’s what is being discussed. \\n So on the one hand, white people were in the main of course, not slaves the way that black people were slaves in the US south leading up to the civil war. On the other hand, Cromwellian captives, among others, were bound up in servitude and sent overseas against their will, where they worked often in misery, for another’s benefit in the absence of a good portion of their rights, possibly to their deaths. The absence of their assent in the matter differentiates them from indentured servants. They have a sentence, not a contract. \\n There was a difference between how a Slave Labourer who had been sentenced to the Barbadoes would be treated, than a purchased slave from Africa. But to assert that captive they were simply indentured servants, who were sometimes \\n >treated like shit \\n as you put it, ignores the distinction of free will and enforced labour of the innocent and unwilling. A distinction your analysis is missing over the course of multiple discussions. \\n Lastly, your quote from Eltis is too fragmentary to be applicable.  Eltis is using a neo-Marxist Core and Periphery framework when he says \\n >Yet Portuguese degradados in Angola, Brazil, and Goa, French convicts sent to Louisiana and Canada, their Spanish counterparts who built the Havana fortifications, and the thousands of Cromwellian prisoners were never chattels and were always subject to \\'Christian usage\\' \\n in discussing the difference between Free Labour in the core, i.e. Europe, and coerced labour in the periphery. \\n But it cannot be said that \\n >Portuguese degradados in Angola, Brazil, and Goa, French convicts sent to Louisiana and Canada, their Spanish counterparts who built the Havana fortifications, and the thousands of Cromwellian prisoners \\n Were not coerced. They were coerced. Did any of the groups named above volunteer for service? No they did not. Are they subject to Christian Usage? Yes, absolutely. So better off than Chattel Slaves but certainly not “free labour of the core.”  They aren’t free or in the core. \\n A. They are in the periphery. \\n B. They are being coerced. \\n Christian usage doesn’t make them “free.” It makes them better off than chattel slaves and yet still not free and not indentured servants with a contract either. They have a sentence. Obviously a further distinction is necessary. \\n >The justification for their being made to work, after all, was a contract which put them under indenture. The whole system of indenture, in other words, was predicated on the assumption that these were free individuals and citizens, who could never be someone else\\'s property. \\n The justification for captives being made to work in these above cases is a sentence, not a contract. Again, we cannot simply lump together a contract entered into freely for a supposed benefit, and a sentence handed down by law or by the legitimacy of force achieved through a military victory. \\n TL;DR: Slave labouring Irish or other forced labourers in the New World or elsewhere had distinct advantages over chattel slaves, especially once chattel slavery is codified, and racial identification and legal stratification comes into existence, but they were not “free.” Their labour and presence were coerced against their will, continuing to ignore that makes this analysis too broad to a fault. \\n Edited: Spelling and formattin\\'. \\n',\n  0),\n ('[I\\'m adapting this from an earlier answer]( so bear with me if it seems addressed at not exactly your question. \\n Yes, kind of, sort of. Inherent is a tough word to parse properly, but suffice to say that there are Constitutional protections which, as they have evolved over the past 200 years, most certainly do protect the rights of American citizens to own a wide array of firearms. \\n It is a common misconception in regards to the Bill of Rights that as originally written, they were intended to protect the rights of the people from the government. This is not exactly true. In reality, the Bill of Rights was written to curb the abilities of the Federal Government, and allow the States to set their own policies with considerable leeway. The Federal Government, for example, could not pass a law limiting the right to assembly, but a state could. To quote from United State v. Cruikshank,  “The First Amendment to the Constitution, prohibiting Congress from abridging the right to assemble and petition, was not intended to limit the action of the State governments in respect to their own citizens, but to operate upon the National Government alone.” \\n So what does this tell us about the Second Amendment, circa 1800? On the one hand, the operative clause was supposed to be taken exactly as written  “the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed\"  but properly read would add in there  \"By the Federal Government\" . On the other however,  “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State”  does actually mean that the Amendment was written with militia in mind, but not in a way to say that possession was tied to membership in the militia (a silly requirement, since  all men between 18 and 45 . Rather, read it like  “The Federal government can’t ban people from owning weapons because it would be oppressive to The States”.  It was delegating the regulation of arms to the States, so that they could be assured a certain level of oversight over their militias. There was no reason that, say, 1800s Pennsylvania couldn’t have prohibited everyone from owning a firearm if the legislature so chose (That being said, many states had their own provisions mirroring the Bill of Rights and limiting what the states could regulate as well. The Pennsylvania Constitution, for instance, included a provision stating *“That the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and the state”. So just because the 2nd Amendment did not protect the right to bear arms on every level should NOT BE TAKEN to imply that it wasn’t nevertheless protected on the state level. Just depended on the state). \\n And for 200+ years, that’s essentially what the 2nd Amendment meant. In Presser v. Illinois, in 1885, the Supreme Court reaffirmed this fact, writing  “But a conclusive answer to the contention that this amendment prohibits the legislation in question lies in the fact that the amendment is a limitation only upon the power of congress and the national government, and not upon that of the state.” \\n But in the early 1900s something HUGE happened. The 1925 Supreme Court case Gitlow v. New York ended with the ruling that the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment applied to the States via the 14th Amendment’s Due Process Clause! Born from this was the process that became known as Incorporation. Slowly, the Bill of Rights began to go through this process and more and more parts of the various Amendments were incorporated against the states. Finally, by the late 60s, aside from some very minor provisions, all that remained unincorporated were the 2nd and 3rd Amendments. Born from this was the assumption by most modern, casual observers, that this was always the case, and thus the assumption that the 2nd Amendment applied to the people in the same way that the 1st Amendment did, which while perhaps a safe assumption, had not yet been verified by the Supreme Court, who did not deign to address this fact in Miller, a Federal case, and the only major 2nd Amendment Ruling of the modern era. \\n It was only in 2010, in a case known as McDonald v. Chicago, that the right to keep a firearm was found to be an incorporated right by the Supreme Court. \\n Now, what does this all mean? Well, technically at least, the Founding Fathers didn’t exactly mean the 2nd Amendment to be taken as we read it now. But it isn’t because of the wording. It clearly grants an individual right “to the people”. It is because of the concept of tiered government that was held by the Founding Fathers and applied to all the Amendments, which was turned out totally by the Incorporation Doctrine some 100+ years later. Perhaps it is an unforeseen development to the likes of Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Hamilton et. al. or maybe they knew they had gotten the ball rolling and envisioned that liberal democracy was heading in that direction. It seems to be that anyone can make whatever argument that they want there, and easily find support for it. But the fact is that it did happen, and it didn’t just affect the 2nd Amendment. It changed the 1st, 3rd, 4th and so one, and is a monumentally important evolution in government and the concept of rights as pertains to the United States and its citizens. \\n So what does this all mean then, for the TL;DR crowd? The 2nd Amendment, as originally written, was not meant to protect the individual’s absolute right to keep and bear arms, but it ISN’T because the Amendment should be read as not pertaining to the individual, but because it only applied to one level of Government. The flipside is that the 2nd Amendment protects the right to firearms for everyone, but applying it on a state level is a 20th century doctrine only made possible by the 14th Amendment that has resulted in this modern interpretation of the Bill of Rights as a whole. \\n \\n This only covers the 2nd Amendment. If I have time, I\\'ll add on to this with some analysis of the subsequent laws that were passed, so please do check back later. \\n',\n  0),\n ('The American perspective of communism as inherently evil is almost completely due to ideological bias.

Everybody being equal doesn\\'t sound too bad, but when everyone gets the same reward for doing work, regardless of who works more, there is no incentive to go above and beyond or excell in the field or industry. \\n Example: if the government paid you and I both $20 to make 100 shoes, why should either of us try to make 101 shoes? \\n Tl;dr- Communism has never existed and fails economically. \\n',\n  0),\n ('I hate to be  that guy  on /r/AskHistorians, but do you happen to have some quality sources to back up your assertions? I feel slightly better being  that guy , in that your response doesn\\'t actually answer the question as posted. \\n I ask specifically because it seems to me to contain a conflation of Wikipedia-driven a-historical information along with some \\'90s received wisdom that\\'s contradicted by a variety of sources from the \\'50s-\\'70s. \\n To be more specific, the byte (as the smallest addressable unit) predates the common usage of an 8-bit byte. Additionally, the 8-bit byte predates 8-bit character encoding. Additionally, the hypothesis that an expanded character encoding expanded the byte size seems wildly against history. As an example, look at the BCPL reference manual from 1967. It doesn\\'t define a byte (as that\\'s implementation and hardware dependent) but all of the examples use a 6-bit byte. Look at the 6th C reference manual, which defines both bytes and characters as being 8-bits, but explicitly says that characters \"occupy the right-most seven bits of an 8-bit byte.\" Pretty much look at anything from the late \\'60s and early \\'70s, and you\\'ll see a hodge-podge headed towards 8-bit bytes. And where you don\\'t (like with the PDP-8\\'s 6-bit bytes (introduced after the introduction of both 7-bit ASCII and 8-bit EBCDIC)) you\\'ll see things humming forward and just using multiple bytes for characters. Which should sound familiar to anyone using Unicode. \\n On top of that, you assert that \"IBM\\'s personal computer became the standard in early computing and ever since the 8 bit byte system has been standard.\" I find that claim to be something I\\'d very much like a source on, my understanding is that the 8-bit byte was widely standardized by nearly every hardware manufacturer from DEC to IBM well before there was such a thing as a \"personal computer\" (yes, including the Altair 8800.) \\n Also, anyone who\\'s calling out character encoding and doesn\\'t call out EBCDIC and System/360...I immediately want to know what sources they\\'re reading. \\n TL;DR Sources please. \\n',\n  0),\n ('There may be a U.S.-centric cultural bias going on here.  The politics of language and identity operate somewhat differently in the United States than in most of the rest of the developed world, even other English-speaking countries.  One thing to realize (hah!) here is that a United States political idea of \"left wing\", was, as least in the 1980 and 1990s, ideologically rather farther to the right than in most of the rest of the Western world.  Simply put, the far-left in the United States is ideologically closer to the center-left or moderate-left found in France or Britian. \\n That\\'s the background.  The other political context here is that the end of the Cold War changed the dynamics of political rhetoric in the United States more than in Canada or Britain.  With the demise of the USSR, two political ideological developments took place in the 1990s (i may be slightly infrining on the 20 year rule, since some events I have in mind took place in 1995 or 1996, I can\\'t recall): \\n 1) Without the bogeyman of \"godless communists\", the right began to flail about in search of new ideological opponents, to put it politely. \\n 2) The left found itself unmoored and fragmenting -- the ideas of socialism and class conciossness seemed to have either \"run their course\" or be entirely bankrupt.  This ideological space allowed new forms of progressive thought and 3rd wave feminism to flourish in ways that hadn\\'t been possible before. \\n It\\'s in this environment in the mid-1990s, that the term \"political correctness\" began to shift from being a more neutral and somewhat light-hearted sense, used strictly within leftst enclaves like academia, and shifted into a term used by the chattering classes as either a smear or a praise, depending on what sort of circles you traveled in. \\n Nothing in this comment can be sourced, since it\\'s all based on my recollections of my parent\\'s dinner party conversations while I was growing up, but I hope I\\'ve been able to be somewhat illuminating. \\n TL;DR: Ideological and linguistical \"goalposts\" have shifted within social and political discourse over the last 30 years or so, at least within the United States. \\n',\n  0),\n ('You\\'re not wrong, its just that its overplayed tremendously. First off Infantry suffered a very serious manpower crises by mid-july, airpower\\'s actual numbers of  killed  enemy armor and vehicles were wildly exaggerated. Hallion\\'s assessment and history of US Air power over Normandy - in his aptly named  Air Power over the Normandy Beaches and Beyond  - provides us with some interesting numbers: \\n Total Sorties flown numbered at 12, 787. The total claims for kills chart in at 6, 251. However, of that number, only 391 were claimed to be  armored  vehicles - not necessarily tanks. Even if we take this exaggerated number at face-value, it still drives home the point that Air Power was not some magical thunderbolt that smited German fighting power. If one read\\'s German AARs and Histories, especially Hubert Meyer\\'s, it becomes evident that Air Power\\'s true contributions to victory came in the form of reconnaissance, area denial and harassment (consider: The 2.SS took two weeks to make a march that should\\'ve lasted 72 hours, if that). The 12.SS History describes their overall personnel and vehicular losses as light to air power, but that it greatly delayed and hampered their advance, forcing them into cover in every instance for hours at a time. Aerial reconnaissance also hampered German artillery, yes. \\n Simple presence of air power doesn\\'t immediately suggest complete restriction of daylight movement and suppression of high-flash howitzers. The Western allies had both the quality and the quantity of airpower to make that a reality; compare this to say, the battles on the Mius River in 1943, in which entire squadrons of IL-2s would make roaring, but poorly coordinated runs against units such as the 3.Panzer moving in open-order during high noon. German tank losses to air power were recorded on both sides as being negligible; and the entire fact that they were hitting Soviet positions in daylight hours with massed armor is telling in and of itself. I just wanted to bounce to the Eastern front to drive home the point that Allied airpower may have been omni-present but that isn\\'t what made it effective, what made it effective was its  flexibility ; an unprecedented (but still very much lacking) level of air-ground co-ordination and well trained, well-drilled pilots to run sorties. \\n That being said, US Artillery had to be husbanded, as a cross-channel supply line and the demands of fighting in Normandy required high HE expenditure. Artillery and airpower being \"omni-present\" would\\'ve probably been of very little comfort to a Rifle Company commander, who would be very lucky indeed to receive either of these assets during the constant drives into the  Bocage.  US Artillery - when well led- was a well-oiled machine; it didn\\'t simply blast away at random. The American\\'s take on the Fire Direction Center, their proliferation of radios and their skill at Time-on-Target and fuse-charges made their artillery powerful, accurate, timely and most importantly, mobile. Almost every American artillery piece was either motorized (as in, towed by a prime mover) or self-propelled. A luxury for German units using horse and buggies to cart around 76 and 105mms. \\n Finally,  yes , the Wehrmacht held a tactical advantage, but the Allied armies were not a horde of incompetents. The myth is exacerbated by several things; chiefly is the fact that the Germans were quite literally holding the best defensive terrain in Europe for stopping a more mobile and flexible enemy. Further, remember that the US Army had expanded to well over 10 Million men from an army of just over 100 thousand in less than two year\\'s time; that feat of mobilization is impressive, but it also means that you\\'re not going to be dealing with the best force. Compare this to the Wehrmacht, which had been steadily expanding and training since 1933, and had at this point just enough veteran formations to maintain this long-established tactical advantage. The British as well were mustering their last great Army, and were undeniably reaching a manpower crisis by June 1944 - they went into France with what they had left, not what they wanted. \\n In all shapes and forms the US Army that landed in June 1944 was the best trained, best armed and best led that the Allied forces deployed in any operation there-to, given its size. They didn\\'t simply hurl men and machines at the enemy, brute force rarely wins battles, and certainly does not produce decisive victories. \\n EDIT: They also beat the Germans through superior mobility. The reason Bradley was forced to play the number\\'s game was largely due to the terrain he was fighting in; when the 12th Army Group was activated and the battle \\'opened up\\' into the heartland of France and the low countries, the Germans simply could not keep up. A combination of heavy attrition in Normandy and outdated communication and armor tactics (both bred for countering far less flexible Soviet armor) meant that August and September was one large \\'Thunder Run\\' for the US forces.  So many people like to point out that none of the D+1 Objectives were realized for the invading forces; but its just fair game to point out that by the end of August the 12th and 21st Army Groups were far beyond the planned and expected Limits of Advance. They made up for lost time, and how. \\n At the basest tactical level, a German rifle squad, if competently led, could put out dizzying amounts of fire. The US Army especially was not designed in 1944 to be fighting small-unit actions, the Battalion was the tactical building block and where organic firepower (Heavy Machineguns, for example) was concentrated. HMGs by contrast were often a company level asset for the Germans, and of course a German rifle platoon had far more GPMGs than its US equivalent. Perfect when the battlefield has been divided by nature into small, individual universes of combat.  TL;DR: Germans had a tactical advantage, aye, but never forget the terrain they held that in - it exacerbated what was already a short-coming into a serious challenge. \\n',\n  0),\n ('> and History is not a science \\n shouldn\\'t it try to be, though?\\nLet me rephrase that.  Perhaps it is completely outside the purview of \"history\" in and of itself, but I always thought/wanted that historical accounts be verified against whatever physical evidence may exist, beyond simply corroboration among competing texts (for instance). \\n and if there does not exist any evidence outside the text, this should be noted as an accompanying fact.  Not necessarily to cast doubt upon the text, but just, you know, to say that \"look, we\\'ve never found any physical evidence for this, but a bunch of people wrote about it, so that\\'s what we have.\" \\n I might be rambling.

Yes, there was the Auld Alliance, and clearly relations with Englnd were always tense but in the wider scheme of things, really the only things that Scotland had to offer secular Europe were mercenaries, a few students at their universities and good, high quality, wool & a loose association with the declining Hanseatic League. \\n In regards to the church, apart from a few curiosities with the diocesan structure, there wasn\\'t much to comment on. In the 6th-8th centuries, the Highlands and Islands had been important centres of Church culture via the Columbine monasteries, but this was more closely linked with Ireland, and in recent centuries the only real contribution had been to support the wrong side in the Papal Schism and a single influential Theologian/Philosopher ([Duns Scotus]( \\n In terms of the Reformation, Scotland was fairly late to the party. Yes, there were protestants in the 1530s and 40s, but they were really a minority, and suppression was fairly thorough, without being bloody. It wasn\\'t until the 1550s that things began to take root and then Reformation happened quite quickly and thoroughly in 1560. The new church was established on a Reformed (Calvinist) Theology, and though there were some initial teething problems, particular in regards to Royal interference, the Church took a Presbyterian structure. \\n (NB. This is very simplified. Things post-reformation were actually much more complex than I\\'m making it sound here, and it took a long time for the Presbyterian structure to take solid hold. However, the early seeds were sown within a few months of the Reformation Parliament) \\n So, what does this have to do with Changing the World? Calvinism is big on godly living according to strict morality, and The nature of the Presbyterian system meant that it was particularly efficient at enforcing this morality onto its parishioners. When you\\'re forced to sit on a hard stool in front of your entire community during church services as punishment, the inclination to re-offend is reduced (in most people). Compound this with the fact that in every parish there was a body of interfering old men obsessed with their neighbours sex lives seeking to set them right, they were scarily efficient at this. Over time, this has an effect on the Scots, effectively changing the national psyche to one of obedience, hard work, and sobriety (Yes, I realise there is a degree of irony in this statement, but just remember that there are always exceptions to overall trends, and by the 19th century the Kirk had become bloated and unfit to purpose, and after a schism in 1849, things were never really the same) \\n So how does this local change affect the whole world? \\n Well, the first thing to draw on is that the Kirk had a strong focus on education. Even before the reformation, there had been 3 universities in Scotland (or 5 depending if you counted the colleges at St Andrews as being distinct institutions, though this is uncommon). In the half century following it, 3 more were set up, and though one of them failed, this left one of Europe\\'s smallest countries with 5 universities. To the best of my knowledge, this is the highest concentration of universities per head of population at the time. Now, though there was a concerted effort to reform the 16th and 17th century institutions by introducing a Reformed curriculum based on the pedagogical philosophy of Peter Ramus, this ultimately failed. It wasn\\'t until the 18th Century that the Universities, especially the University of Edinburgh, reached their peak as world leading institutions, signalling the start of the Scottish Enlightenment. Adam Smith, David Hume and Joseph Black were all part of this \"movement\", and Benjamin Franklin was certainly influenced by a number of Edinburgh men at the time. Though the \"Scottish Enlightenment\" as it were ended by the end of the 18th century, the Universities were still prominent enough (and linked closely to the Kirk still, through the requirement of signing the Hardline Calvinist Westminster Confession of Faith in order to Graduate) that the attracted and produced people such as Darwin, James Clerk Maxwell, James Watt and Joseph Lister. However, following the 1849 schism I mentioned above, the link between the Universities and the Kirk proved a detriment, as many great minds were deprived of their academic careers due to being on the wrong side, and a number of historians have marked this as the final nail in the coffin of the Golden Age of Scottish Education and Enlightenment. \\n In more political terms, well Scotland\\'s sole attempt at Colonial enterprise was an epic failure, simply because they were more concerned with stocking their ships holds with hats and Bibles than victuals. Also, the most logical place for the Scots to chose to embark their adventure was Darien in Panama. That\\'s right, not only were the Scots trying to muscle in on Spanish territory, but more importantly the SCOTS were trying to establish a colony in the tropics. Is anyone else seeing a flaw in this plan? So the Darien expedition literally bankrupted the country, leading to the 1707 Act of Union. So now, because the Scots were, arguably, more interested in Missionary work than creating a useful colony, they were forced to compromise their sovereignty into a state that actually had a strong colonial presence already, and one which they were now able to utilise. \\n So very indirectly, the Scottish presence and influence in Canada, the Southern US and Australia, and Scottish \"Business interests\" in the Caribbean (i.e. Tobacco, Sugar and Slaves) can be attributed to the Kirk. This is a bit tenuous though, and there is a much more convincing argument. Remember when I mentioned that the Reformation created a culture of obedience and hard work in Scotland? What do you get when you combine that with the already English economics and naval prowess, Anglo-Saxon racist ideologies and a Europe-wide desire to carve up and divide the world among themselves, and then throw in the aforementioned Missionary Zeal? You guessed it. The British Empire. To say that it was built entirely by the Scots would of course be an overstatement (and I can\\'t quite figure out how to fit the use of Highland Regiments as tools of the Empire into my model), but in terms of administration and colonial civil service, Scots were fundamental to making sure that the British Empire was successful. \\n On a final note, just to show how the Reformed Kirk has had an effect on the world all the way up to today, it should be pointed out that Gordon Brown, who may or may not  (depending on your political affiliations) have caused the UK\\'s current economic problems, is a Son of the Manse. \\n TL;DR Scottish Presbyterians helped make the modern world, and then made sure it ran smoothly (except for one recent exception) \\n',\n  0),\n (\"What are you talking about!

That, and a shelling of a fort near the mouth of the Columbia River earlier that year, were both carried out by the Japanese [aircraft-equipped submarine I-25](  So it wasn\\'t exactly a major menacing of the coast, but they were thinking about it. \\n Regarding Pearl Harbor, in Feb-March 1942 the Japanese did plan a serial operation  (\"K\")  but it was botched and of very limited scope anyway (2 planes).  More important was the reconnaissance involved.  But even the original Operation Z attack of December 7th was a surprise to its planners in how successfully they avoided detection.  Doing that again once hostilities were ongoing would have meant a significant diversion of resources against a more active, expectant enemy.  Had they conquered Samoa or Midway, however, you might have seen them try.  The Pacific war situation was never secure enough to permit the gamble, just as it really wasn\\'t for the US until 1944 (Doolittle raid notwithstanding) as PzKfw below points out. \\n TL,DR: Successive Pearl Harbors weren\\'t possible because the resources to carry it off were needed elsewhere once hostilities were underway. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Remember, although he was a big proponent of \"Sonno-Joi\" (Revere the Emperor, expel the barbarian), the reforms were not moving in a way that he felt was the correct way.

One of the primary reasons to invade Korea, although some may disagree with me was so that the Samurai could have a job again.

She eyed them boldly at their approach, as she pulled water from the bubbling stream the townspeople called Artacie, which they kept free from animals. Now, you must remember that my men had been away from women for a goodly time, and such a winsome woman waggled their willies. \\n The whole book is like this. I recommend it (sort of); it's a hoot.

What do you mean by the average Nazi? You mean Nazi party members? (not all Germans were Nazi party members), Soldiers- Wehrmacht or Waffen SS or the SS? or citizens at large? \\n Let me attempt to address each of these segments nevertheless.... \\n (1) Soldiers, As other forum patrons have pointed out, the German military had the conscripted  Wehrmacht, and the initially volunteer driven Waffen SS -at the start, when Germany did not have manpower constraints, it was open only to \"pure Aryans\", but towards the end of the war, you had the equivalents of SS Foreign legions and \"racial purity\" was given the boot. \\n The Wehrmacht was entirely complicit, especially on crimes on the Ost front. From a logistics, and overarching command perspective, the Whermacht was in charge. Hitler\\'s orders, for instance the infamous Kommisar Befhel which ordered the outright killing of Soviet Commisars or the loosely worded order that vaguely equated Jews to partisans, and essentially wanted them handed over to SS / Gestapo follow up squads were all routed through army commands. Generals (especially those wanted to curry favour with Hitler, or the one\\'s who genuinely believed in the Nazi philosophies)  even added their own \"flavour\" to these commands. Some famous names like Manstien or Guderian either passed on the orders without question or added their own flavour. \\n Some leading generals like Blaskowitz or Edler Von Daniels (was a part of the 6th Army which was wiped out in Stalingrad) did object to such commands, and issued strict orders to conduct war on a professional basis, but they were very few in number. \\n So systemically, atleast the higher commands knew about the planned atrocities right from the start of the war, and clearly this percolated down the ranks. General Daniels infact had to issue an order banning soldiers and officers from being present at the site of any \"cleansing\" and also they were banned from taking photographs (source Anthony Beevor\\'s Stalingrad), so visibly there was participation by the rank and file of the Wehrmacht. \\n Starving and all round mistreatment of Sov prisoners was done at all levels (mind you this is as big an atrocity as any other) of the Wehrmacht, even when Sov prisoners started canibalising themselves because of starvation level diets, Quarter masters refused to intervene as it meant \"taking food from a German soldier\". \\n When the Einzatsgruppen were running amok, the Wehrmacht knew, as the Einztasgrupp\\'s came (nominally atleast) under Wehrmacht command. While the generals in charge disassociated themselves from the activities of the Einzatsgruppen, the fact remains that they were both aware, and did nothing to stop it. \\n Clearly, the Wehrmacht and the Waffen SS had a great degree of complicity when it came to knowledge of Nazi crimes, and a lot of them while might have not participated overtly, they supported such acts for whatever twisted world view they might have had. \\n Civilians and the average low ranking Nazi party member - There has always been a debate on this subject, as to the extent of complicity the average German citizen had, and I will attempt to answer it using the smaller liquidation program, the so called Aktion T4. Essentially this was a \"small\" program that focussed on liquidating \"undesirables\". While the numbers are disputable (and range from 50,000 to 1,50,000) there is no denying the fact that the Nazi party did everything to keep this program under wraps. Still there is enough evidence to suggest that the common citizen knew about it, there are confirmed reports of  Bishops writing to leaders to put an end to the program and of even the victims knowing about it when the buses pulled up to take them away.

The concept of a \"Global Culture\", in which you can go to most of the developed places in the world and not feel like things are all that different, is extremely new. Before the Industrial Revolution, and certainly for a while afterwards as well, life was very different for at least 95% of people in different geographical areas (the wealthy were already beginning to develop monoculture). \\n Because of this, the country which \"ran\" the empire had a much weaker hold over its constituents. I\\'m quite familiar with Roman politics, so I\\'ll use Rome as an example. \\n Originally, only people from the city of Rome were considered Romans, and only a small area around the city was considered to be \"Rome proper\". Everything else was simply conquered territory. As the empire grew, citizenship of Rome was handed out to allies throughout the peninsula. By the Imperium (Julius Caesar and later), the Italian peninsula was considered an entire political unit, the \"country\" under which existed the rest of the Empire. Everywhere else was considered an annexed territory or \"province\", ruled by a king-like proconsul who had almost complete administrative and military control over his assigned territory. \\n There is definitely a pattern throughout history of the original \"country\" from which the empire was born allowing its citizens privileges at the expense of the conquered territories. Commonly, this existed in the form of higher taxes on the territories, enforced by the military might of the central government.

Today I thought I\\'d share some musings on the Biblical  Book of Esther . Set in Achaemenid Persia, apparently during the reign of Xerxes, the story recounts how the  Jewish girl Esther becomes queen of Persia and how, with the help of her cousin Mordecai, she thwarts a plot by the evil vizier Haman to wipe out the Jews. In the end, Esther and Mordecai emerge as the \"powers behind the throne,\" as they both enjoy the King\\'s favor and gratitude. The mystery, of course, is whether any of this is historical. While many (myself included) think it best to treat  Esther  as a historical novella rather than strict history, others have argued at least for the actual existence of Mordecai. \\n I initially stumbled upon the debate over Mordecai while studying the so-called \"Fortification Tablets\" from Persepolis (viewable  here , mention an individual (or possibly individuals) called  Mar-du-ka , \"man of Marduk,\" from which the name \"Mordecai\" derives. Although overzealous scholars sometimes identify Marduka as  the  Mordecai of the Bible, the evidence is too limited to permit such a conclusion. The issue really seems moot in my opinion, and again I do not subscribe to a literal approach to the Hebrew scriptures. At the same time, I also do not find convincing the equally-dubious (and fallaciously-argued) attempts to cast Mordecai as the figure of Marduk (the Babylonian god) and Esther as Ishtar--but that is besides the point of this post. \\n So here\\'s the caveat: I noticed recently that one of the entries in the archive refers not to Marduka himself but rather  Mar-du-ka-be  (PF 273.4-5). Editor Richard T. Hallock hesitantly translates this as \"the Marduka (people),\" presumably because other geographic-gentilic designations from this period feature a similar construction: for example, the  Kur-ka-be  (\"Carians\": PF 123.2),  Par-šib-be  (\"Persians\": PF 871.3), and  Hi-in-du-iš-be  (\"Indians\": PF 1548.5-6) cited in the Fortification Tablets, or the  Mar-ku-iš-be  (\"Margians\": DB 21.3) and  Par-tu-maš-be  (\"Parthians\": DB 35.68) listed on the  Elamite version , but such an explicit connection between a people and a deity is, as far as I can tell, unparalleled within the extant corpus of texts. Conversely, peoples are in a few instances tied directly to individuals: \"the Mišakaš people of Hystaspes,\" (PF 1596.6-8); or \"people of Maušudda and Iršena,\" (PF 1622.5-7) who both appear elsewhere as officials. Moreover, the Babylonians already receive an ethnic identifier in the form  Ba-pi-li-ra  (PF 783.4-5) and its variants. \\n If  Mar-du-ka-be  does indeed mean something like \"the Marduka people,\" attention must be drawn to a rather curious line in  Esther : \"But he [the Persian official Haman] disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had told him who  the people of Mordecai  were; therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews,  the people of Mordecai , who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus [=Xerxes?].\" (3:6, NASB transl.) The repetition here places unusual emphasis on the phrase \"people of Mordecai.\" ( ‘m mrdky ), which then matches the  Mar-du-ka-be  of the Fortification texts. I unfortunately lack the linguistic expertise to say much more than that. \\n Now,  Esther  also describes a \"Book of Chronicles of the Kings of Media and Persia\" ( spr dbry hymym lmlky mdy wprs : 10:2; cf. 2:23, 6:1) and even insists upon its own historicity by citing this official Persian account. The existence of similar documents is somewhat corroborated by the Ctesias\\' claim that he studied the \"royal writings\" (βασιλικαὶ ἀναγραφαί: Diodorus 2.22.5) or \"royal parchments\" (βασιλικαὶ διφθέραι: 2.32.4) during his residency at the court of Artaxerxes II. We have the testimony of Herodotus as well, who reports that Xerxes tasked his scribes with recording the names and origins of his best officers at the Battle of Salamis. (8.90.4) I believe it is possible, therefore, that the formula \"people of Mordecai\" originates from Persian administrative terminology; hence why the author of  Esther  emphasizes Mordecai\\'s role as a representative of his community rather the community itself. Perhaps a historical Mordecai or Marduka really did advocate on behalf of his people, even if his accomplishments fell far short of rescuing them from genocide, which  Esther  then romanticizes based on some short entries in the royal records? \\n This is all extremely speculative, of course, and I\\'m not sure I even buy my own argument; at any rate, I still find it highly unlikely that two well-placed Jews were pulling the strings behind the scenes in fifth-century Persia. But if you got this far, thank you for taking the time to read this post and joining me in some historical exercise. :D \\n TL;DR : The Jews Esther and Mordecai were probably not \"powers behind the throne\" during the time of Xerxes as claimed in the  Book of Esther , though the story may have some slight basis in reality. \\n',\n  0),\n ('>Its hard to exactly pin down because English has such a huge vocabulary. \\n This is a myth about English, and is also cited about \"modern\" languages versus \"primitive\" languages. \\n All languages have \"a large vocabulary\", and for a couple of very good reasons, it\\'s just plain impossible to actually go and count how many words are in a language. The first reason is that there really is no such thing as a language. We can produce an abstraction which is a description of what people do (and that\\'s generally how almost all work in linguistics proceeds), but really, since languages are living entities that are used by people, we have to look at what people actually do. And when we do that, a few facts become abundantly clear. \\n First, that people\\'s vocabularies are not fixed. People can and do learn new words, and can stop using old words. Do these words that people only use once or a few times and never really again cease to be part of their vocabulary? It\\'s not exactly clear. And, in any case, some words are used much more frequently than others.  Zipf\\'s law , the frequency of a word (how often it appears in the corpus) is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. So, for instance, in the Brown Corpus,  the  is the most frequent word and is about 7% of the corpus. The second-most frequent word is  of  and it accounts for about 3.5% of the corpus. Many, many words only appear once in the entire corpus. \\n Another issue is that what comprises people\\'s vocabularies is not the same. Many English speakers would really struggle if I asked them what the word  clew  meant. But sailors would know that it refers to the aft bottom corner of a triangle sail. Do sailors then have a larger vocabulary than other English speakers? Probably not--many people get, through the course of their lives, a lot of specialized/technical vocabulary that\\'s not necessarily shared. \\n These, though, are just within one language. What about across languages? Some languages, like Mandarin, are relatively  analytic , meaning that they like to have one word for one meaning--even when it comes to things we\\'re perfectly happy to restrict to parts of words in English, like plural markers or past tense markers: \\n \\n Wǒ dāng le bīng. \\n I become [PFV]( soldier \\n \\'I became a soldier.\\' \\n \\n Other languages, like Ainu, are extremely  synthetic , and can more or less have what is a sentence in English as a single word. For instance, in this sentence,  asiretarare  means \\'we stuck [them] into the ground\\' and could stand by itself as a grammatically complete sentence: \\n \\n Imanit opitta humneanta a-sir-etara-re. \\n skewer all one.place we-ground-stick.into-make \\n \\'We stuck the skewers into the ground all in one place.\\' \\n \\n Does Ainu have less words than Mandarin if you can combine lots of parts together to make \"sentence-like\" words? Is it even fair to count this way? It\\'s not really clear, but Ainu dictionaries--at the very least--aren\\'t really smaller than Mandarin dictionaries (well, they are, technically, but that\\'s only because there are probably no native speakers of Ainu left and quite a bit more Mandarin speakers around). \\n So tl;dr, while it doesn\\'t really make sense to talk about the numbers of words found in a language, it\\'s likely that English isn\\'t particularly special even when we try. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"I think I have arrived a bit too late to this thread so this may not get seen. \\n This question I believe boils down to when the state was carrying out the greatest level of redistribution. \\n I'm going to be answering this from a UK perspective but the general theory should apply for all developed nations. Straight away in the UK we can rule out the 1800's as having the most evenly distributed wealth simply because of the lack of government redistribution that was in effect. We had the New Poor Laws of 1834 but they were relatively minimal. We have to get onto Charles Booth and Benjamin Seebohm Rowntree. At the very end of the 1900's they carried out some of the first wide-scale surveys of poverty and argued for a minimum standard of provision after finding poverty to be a structural. \\n From their work there were a number of policy outcomes such as; the old age pensions act of 1908, the national insurance act of 1911 and so on. Here we see the start of comprehensive state involvement. By 1939 Britain has arguably the most comprehensive system of welfare in the world. However it failed to cope with the mass unemployment of the 30's and the aftermath of world war one. \\n Hopefully you can see how I'm attempting, I'm not sure to what effect, to create a timeline over the last 200 years of government redistribution efforts. \\n The Beveridge report of 1942 is commonly seen as the base for wartime social transformation. He identified the five great evils that the state needed to address (namely; want, squalor, ignorance, disease and idleness). He was a massive architect of the UK system of welfare and his ideas of universalism was really embraced by the nation.   From his initial proposal rose much greater ideas of socially just, materially equal society. \\n So in this period we saw the creation of the National Health service, expansion of the education system, the national insurance act which allowed for unemployment benefits, sick benefits and so on and  finally the pursuit of full employment under the ideas proposed by Keynes. \\n The following UK governments were at first extremely supportive of the welfare state and its universalism. However! This did not last long, in the 1950's we saw the start of means-related benefits being brought in (In which your income level was taken into account in determining the level of benefit that you received). Labour brought in an earnings related pension scheme in 1957. In the 50's the conservatives allowed the privatisation of pensions, further undermining universalism. In 1965 Labour brought in further earnings related supplements on a host of benefits. The logic behind this is that it is much cheaper for a state to run, they have to pay out less, however it creates issues such as poverty traps, where people are better off on a lower income because they then have access to certain benefits. \\n So over the next decades this universal system became further eroded and then along came stop-go inflation in the 70's and the diminishing of Keynesian and the labour party abandoned high employment as a commitment. From this point onwards with the inception of monetarism and Thatcherism (This is also reflected in the US with Reganism) the state played a much more diminished role in redistribution and it hasn't since. \\n So! Perhaps on a slight tangent (TL;DR?), I would argue that wealth in the UK and as it appears to be in the US was most evenly distributed during the period of the 1950's where the idea of universalism and creating a socially just society was at its zenith and the State was carrying out the greatest levels of redistribution. \\n Happy to provide sources and clarification if this is actually read by anyone! Apologies for the rambling and the tangential nature. Frankly I used this as a lovely piece of distraction from much more tedious work. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('Why was the Wehrmacht unable to capture Moscow in \\'41?  You already mentioned most of the most relevant factors, most of them being basic problems with the German campaigns of \\'41.  In no particular order, the Germans failed because of: Truly abysmal intelligence, horrendous weather, sparse and thoroughly unsuitable logistics, thoroughly un-German strategies being forced by geography, and Soviet reinforcements drawn off of the Japanese front. \\n Abysmal Intelligence  - One of the greatest flaws of the Wehrmacht that surfaced time and time again in World War II was its very poor grasp of intelligence work.  In this case, Hitler (and more importantly, the German General Staff) did indeed predict that the USSR would fold and collapse with one swift, stiff blow.  Multiple times, members of the German General Staff wrote in their war diaries that the Soviets were on their last leg and that the next battle would spell their doom and dissolution.  Invariably, they were woefully incorrect, and by the end of the German campaign season, the Wehrmacht had inflicted more casualties in deaths, wounds, and imprisonment / death-in-captivity than they\\'d estimated the Soviets to have men on the front  period . \\n General Winter  - If you look at a map of the Eastern Front in January 1942, you\\'d be forgiven for thinking it had been drawn by a drunkard with Parkinson\\'s Disease.  The front makes no military sense whatsoever, with salients and bulges in the strangest and most precarious of places.  The reason for this irregularity is that after the November rains, the weather quite literally froze German divisions in place.  All of Germany\\'s wonderful mechanization and all of Germany\\'s less wonderful but equally important supply transport tended to fare very,  very  poorly in the harsh winter - certainly German logistics were in very poor shape compared with their Soviet equivalents, which leads to... \\n Unsuitable Logistical Trail  - ...a supply conundrum, though one that had been staring them in the face for months.  While Hitler and the General Staff sure did think the fighting would be over long before Christmas, that was not the reason they failed to send winter coats to their troops.  The real reason is far more mundane: in modern terms, the Wehrmacht was faced with a horrific bandwidth problem from the very start.  Gone were the days that an army could subsist on the land it occupied - instead, they were reliant on supplies built in factories in the Rhineland and other industrial centers and stockpiled in supply depots far behind the front.  However, there were only so many railway lines heading from German depots to the front lines, and only so many trains to load in Germany and unload in Russia.  The choice faced by the Wehrmacht during the  entire  invasion from Summer onwards could be roughly boiled down to, \"We need to send our troops 1) food so they don\\'t starve, 2) coats so they don\\'t freeze, and 3) fuel and ammo so they can advance successfully - Pick 1.5\" \\n Thoroughly Un-German Strategies  - You might be thinking that logistics is a problem that should have been evident from the start; if so, then take a minute to follow a brief narrative about the German Way of War:  Since the Germans, and the Prussians before them, began making a name for themselves, the Wehrmacht\\'s predecessors had always been surrounded by larger, more powerful enemies who could raise and maintain a far larger army than Prussia or Germany.  In response, the German / Prussian tradition emphasized a war of movement, or  bewegungskrieg  ( not  Blitzkrieg - that word is an almost completely Western invention, courtesy of sensationalist newspapers).  In this war of movement, multiple independent units would maneuver against the enemy and coordinate concentric attacks against the main body of the enemy from multiple directions.  In essence, German doctrine emphasized surrounding the enemy and encircling them if possible, then attacking inwards. \\n Looking at a map of Barbarossa, it should become patently obvious that by advancing eastward, the front line does the opposite of attacking inwards - German forces operated in three different sectors, moving in three different, diverging directions, diluting the Wehrmacht as a whole and spreading their forces precariously thin.  As a result, when the thermometers froze and the transmission boxes followed, the German army in front of Moscow numbered a good number of divisions and corps arrayed in a ragged, undisciplined arc.  They were organized into a single Army Group, comprised of six armies that had not received reinforcements because the trains were tied up delivering all the fuel and ammunition they\\'d sucked up through the supply chain. \\n Soviet (Siberian) Reinforcements  - Returning to the first item on this list, the first sign that the Germans had of Soviet reinforcements around Moscow was when the following happened: \\n \\n 29th and 31st Armies attacked the northern side of the Klin salient \\n \\n 30th Army and 1st Shock Army attacked the center of the Klin salient \\n \\n 20th, 16th, and 5th Armies attacked the southern side of the Klin salient \\n \\n 50th Army and a scratch group of mixed cavalry and mechanized forces smashed into Guderian\\'s Panzergruppe at Tula \\n \\n Much, much more. \\n \\n \\n A total of 17 mostly-fresh Soviet armies and 2 large cavalry corps, organized into 4 army groups ( Fronts  in Soviet parlance) smashed into less than half their number of bloodied German defenders in front of Moscow.  Many of the Wehrmacht\\'s generals came very close to losing their nerve in the face of the completely unexpected counterattack of fresh Soviet troops.   If nothing else on this list spelled the end to German delusions of taking Moscow, this was it. \\n The simple summation of all these factors is that the Wehrmacht was geared to fight the German way of war - Defeat a large, Western European adversary ([cough] France [cough]) by maneuvering like a madman, marching your troops towards the sound of gunfire, and invariably falling upon the enemy from all directions while supplied by the generous rail systems criss-crossing Western Europe.  By picking to fight a war so squarely  not  in their comfort zone, the Wehrmacht doomed themselves to failure period. \\n TL;DR: the Wehrmacht was completely unsuited to conflict with the USSR and lost because of multiple factors - primarily winter, horribad logistics, and a massive, undetected Soviet counterattack. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Great answer! \\n My questions came from listening the the history of byzantium podcast, which naturally focuses on much later. \\n You say that caracalla gave citizenship to everyone, how did that effect all the stuff you talk about...basically what happened next?! \\n And at the other end of roman history...Having done some roman history in school I have dim memeories of the various political offices during the republic, quaestor, consul, tribune, aideile (spelling??) etc etc etc, how were they chosen?

The Tu-134 was built in the wake of Kruschev flying on a Caravelle and admiring how quiet it was. They basically adapted the standard Tupolev military bomber design to become a T-tail passenger aircraft with rear mounted engines, and ruggedised to deal with unprepared airstrips. The anhedral design increases manoeuvrability, but reduces lateral stability however it decreases the tendency to Dutch Roll, I suppose for military aircraft it's not such a big deal and they just bolted military wings on to a civilian fueselage. \\n Civil aviation in the Soviet Union wasn't in as big a boom as the West during the time, so you'll often see either straight out converted military aircraft or designs based on military aircraft.

This model was actually fairly novel, and was only developed by the Portuguese after discovered that, one, sugar would grow well in tropical climes like those found in Azores or Madeira, and, two, it was easier to control slaves if they were taken from their homeland. This combination -- the cash crop of sugar and the access to and transportation of labor -- was the essential piece of the model of plantation slavery that we're familiar with in much of the Americas. \\n The Portuguese were the first to be heavily involved in the slave trade -- the British and the Dutch would be involved later, and the Spanish were never particularly involved and preferred to buy their slaves from the Portuguese (although the Portuguese had to obtain special licences from the Spanish mainland in order to trade with Spanish colonies, which lengthened the process and encouraged smuggling). Through their feitoria trading posts, which the Portuguese had established in the Kongo Empire and in what is now Angola, the Portuguese had more access than anyone else to Africans. This meant that prospective slave owners did not have to pay the additional price of a tariff, wait for an official recognized trading ship with the proper permits, or pay a smuggler extra money to arrive before the official ships. \\n Brasil was also optimally placed, relative to Africa, so that slave ships could move from Brasil and to Africa, and vice versa. The trade winds allowed ships to skirt the Brazilian coastline, docking at various ports, before taking off over the Atlantic towards Africa. It was even easier to go from Africa to Brasil. \\n So the combined factors of (1) being able to implement plantation slavery before anyone else, (2) being heavily involved in the slave trade and being able to bypass tariffs, and (3) having low transportation costs, allowed Brazilian slave owners to buy slaves cheaply. This meant that, unlike the British, they were less concerned with making sure that slaves lived long enough to reproduce. Their greater access to Africans, relative to the Spanish, also allowed for a terrifying scale unseen in any of the other cities, polities, or later, colonies, in the Americas. Because the slaves were so replaceable, and because sugar was so lucrative, owners didn't really care that their investments would likely die after two years of hard labor, often losing limbs to processing mills, dying of disease, dying of malnutrition, or dying due to injury.

The British and French had been attempting to improve their strategic position in North America for some time. The British went so far as to offer the Republic of Texas a guarantee of sovereignty, military assistance, and economic aid if they would stay an independent republic as opposed to joining the US. The British were not doing this out of the kindness of their heart, it would give them a chance to exert influence on the continent and check US expansion.

It certainly requires further explanation of what exactly you mean/are referring to in your point. \\n Ireland elected MPs to the UK parliament, the Act of Union made them part of the UK. While the political system at the time was certainly flawed and the Irish minority made it hard to have any significant impact on UK policies it's also not the same as British colonial rule like you'd see in India. It's also worth bearing in mind that Britain is not a monolith, it had competing political parties who had rather different views on all sorts of topics, the Irish included. The fact that the parties, and policies, changed part way through the Famine is worth bearing in mind. \\n 'Conquest' is often a problematic word. Rarely are things so straightforward as to simply be a 'conquest.' If you're talking about Strongbow-era Norman invasion that's very different than if we're talking about William of Orange Battle of the Boyne era policies. In both cases, though, it is unfair to use the same word that we would use to describe Caesar's Gallic Wars without some further explanation. \\n Even 'English' is a difficult word in Anglo-Irish relations. Even during the Middle Ages when we have a clear language barrier who exactly was English and who was Irish was difficult to determine. After hundreds of years of 'English' settlement in Ireland and a closer relationship between the two islands this gets even more messy. Hundreds of pages have been written about what exactly makes a nationality and they're arguments are worth bearing in mind. \\n TL;DR History be complicated, yo. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('I had a chuckle to see another North Korea flair in this topic of all places. Cheers, /u/koliano! \\n This isn\\'t my area of expertise, so a really detailed answer is beyond me. However, the Irish famine is a pretty common topic while you\\'re studying periods of mass hunger, and it was something I saw pop up occasionally while reading about the mechanics behind North Korea\\'s famine (1994-1998). There\\'s something that I think might provide some helpful context for your question -- namely, how we study and think about famine has changed a lot over the last 40 years, and the line between \"genocide\" and \"famine\" has gotten blurrier as we recognize that famine is not really an accident. \\n So -- was the Irish \"potato famine\" a genocide against the Irish? \\n Short answer:  The English didn\\'t commit genocide by the strictest definition of the term, but they did create the circumstances that led to the famine. \\n Long answer:  As others have pointed out, there\\'s a troublesome and often politically-charged distinction to be made between genocide and famine: \\n \\n Genocide implies intent.  It\\'s not enough for millions of people to die: Somebody has to  want them dead  and engineer a way to do it, or capitalize on a situation likely to result in mass death. Nobody wants to be told they were responsible for genocide; it\\'s a severe blow to the moral and political authority of the country involved. The Turks resist efforts to characterize [what the Armenians call the \"Great Crime\"]( as genocide. Russia will tell you to fuck off when you raise the issue of the [Holodomor]( and Stalin\\'s being a huge asshole to the Ukrainians. The Chinese government [only recently stopped censoring public discussion of the famine]( related to the Great Leap Forward. Nobody wants to admit to having committed genocide or -- if it\\'s not genocide by the technical definition of the term -- anything that looks like it. \\n By contrast,  famine is seen as a tragedy that nobody could have prevented.  Crops fail. Drought happens. Diseases, predators, and wildfires kill livestock. Earthquakes and floods destroy your ability to move food around. Something bad happens that interferes with your society\\'s ability to grow, store, or transport food, and lots of people die despite your best efforts. Famine is the second horseman of the apocalypse, perennial as the grass, cold and grimly present as its brothers pestilence, war, and death. It is ubiquitous in human history and the immutable lesson is that it can happen to anyone. \\n \\n Except it doesn\\'t. Certain human societies have been strangely resistant to famine despite weathering the same shocks that caused mass starvation in similar circumstances elsewhere. \\n Historians and economists had a collective \"Eureka!\" moment in the late 20th century when we realized that famine DOESN\\'T just happen, and that it probably never has. Hunger can happen despite your best efforts to prevent it, but  famine is the result of politics . \\n Before we go any farther, we need to talk about a guy named Amartya Sen.  He\\'s an Indian economist and historian who\\'s written a lot of really famous and influential pieces about a variety of topics, and he was awarded the 1999 Nobel Prize for his work on welfare economics. In terms of popular reach, he\\'s probably best-known for [a 1990 essay on \"More Than 100 Million Women Are Missing,\"]( which addressed the result of sex-selective abortions in Asia. However, in the academic world he\\'s arguably most famous for [his work on famine in human history]( and in particular a theory that sounds bananas when you first hear it, and then more and more frighteningly plausible. \\n I\\'ll break it into two parts: \\n \\n Sen argued that no famine over the last 1,000 years can be attributed to anything other than primarily man-made causes.  This took a while to get traction; we\\'re used to saying that X famine was caused by a flood, or Y famine happened because of a drought, etc. Sen pointed out that natural disasters and crop failures are actually pretty common, but famines aren\\'t usually the result. Left to their own devices, humans are pretty good at finding and storing food as proof against unpredictable shortages. In order to create a famine, you have to have a bad, unstable, and/or corrupt political/economic system that can\\'t weather a sudden shock and is thrown into crisis. We\\'ve gotten used to blaming the shock (e.g., the flood, the drought), when in reality it\\'s just a convenient excuse. The real cause is the shitty and inflexible system that existed before it.  \\n Sen further argued that no famine has occurred in a democracy with a free press.  The basic idea is that government that isn\\'t accountable to its people is notoriously unresponsive to its needs, and a free press is good at noticing and publicizing problems that government needs to address. There have been some quibbles over this, mostly related to pockets of continuing hunger in India, but for the most part this is a pretty uncontroversial theory. \\n \\n Sen published  his first work on famine in 1981  due to rice and transport ship confiscations setting off a price panic. \\n So let\\'s consider the Irish potato famine :  Again, I have to leave the nitty-gritty details to someone with a better command of this period than I\\'ve got, but I can tell you about the commentary that the Irish famine attracts when historians and statisticians are discussing the mechanics of hunger in modern works. \\n The potato blight has been commonly cited as the reason that the famine happened, and it\\'s entirely true that it played a role. The lack of genetic diversity among the strain of potatoes being grown in Ireland at the time made the island incredibly susceptible to the blight. However, it was a classic example of a \"shock\" that revealed the underlying corruption in the economic system that surrounded it. The blight may have started the famine, but it didn\\'t actually cause it (if that distinction makes any sense). \\n So what did cause it?  Britain\\'s Corn Laws were an aggressively protectionist series of tariffs enacted with the intent to keep grain prices high for the benefit of domestic producers. (TL:DR: Landowners didn\\'t want to compete against cheap grain from abroad and also had to pay their farm laborers a living wage, so Parliament levied high taxes on foreign grain and tweaked them as necessary to try to bump domestic grain to what they considered ideal prices.) The Irish poor (of whom there were many, for a variety of very complicated historical and socioeconomic reasons) were largely unable to afford grain as a result of the Corn Laws, and on the generally-small holdings they farmed (for which they paid punitive rents to largely absentee English landlords) could only grow potatoes in sufficient quantity to feed their families. \\n The potato was thus the staple food, and the blight an utter catastrophe. When potatoes were no longer available, the poor burned through their meager savings quickly to buy grain, and when that ran out, they starved en masse. Parliament repealed the Corn Laws two years into the famine, but it was too little and too late, and also didn\\'t address the other systemic issues (principally landlord exploitation) that contributed to the famine. \\n So it\\'s pretty apparent why the genocide/famine distinction is a touchy one here: \\n \\n Did the English commit genocide against the Irish?  Not as such.  \\n Did they create the circumstances that led to the famine?  Yes, and most historians judge the government\\'s response to the famine as woefully inadequate, to compound the issue. \\n \\n',\n  0),\n (\"It is important to note that assimilation of French language and culture  was  the ultimate policy goal of the British in Quebec from roughly 1759 until 1867.  Governor James Murray headed a military government of the colony in the years after conquest in 1759.  The Catholic Church, given its fundamentally anti-revolutionary nature, was willing to assist the British in the pacification of the population, and thus the clergy kept their social position. \\n As indicated by /u/rick7475, the Quebec Act (1774) would later guarantee the civil liberties of French-Canadians.  Quebec as a province, but in particular the fortress at Quebec City, was integral to the defence of British North America. The British recognized it as soon as they incorporated the colony into their Empire, and ensured the cooperation of the local population. \\n After the Loyalist migration in the wake of the Revolutionary War, the hope was that the influx of English and Protestant settlers would change the demographics of Quebec.  However, settlement was confined almost entirely to modern Ontario (from 1791-1867 known as Upper Canada) and the Maritimes.  Quebec remained culturally and linguistically distinct. \\n After rebellions in 1837 and 1838, the Act of Union (1840) incorporated Upper and Lower Canada into a single province.  Again, the melting pot that the British desired never came to pass.  Montreal was the largest city in Canada during these years, and Anglophones and Francophones lived in harmony.  The Anglo-Protestant elite dominated business and  politics, but the French Catholic remained the majority population.  Meanwhile, rural Quebec remained staunchly Catholic and relied on agriculture rather than commerce. \\n With Confederation in 1867, the British washed their hands of the issue.  The British North America Act (1867) constitutionally enshrined French as Canada's second official language, and allowed for French Catholic schooling and other civil rights. \\n TL;DR:  The British tried to assimilate Quebec, failed, and eventually gave up. \\n Sources: J.M.

It consumed about 20-40 million lives, and I don\\'t think the British wanted any part of that. \\n Would it be possible?  Sure.  But as the post above points out, economic imperialism was more profitable and less risky than political imperialism.  The cost of occupying China would be immense; they could get everything they wanted with unequal treaties, and let the Qing government take the heat from the pissed off Chinese populace. \\n Ultimately, colonialism at this point was a profit-driven enterprise, not a drive to rule the world and paint the whole map one color (though there was an idea of \"great power status\" and overseas colonial possessions being tied together).  Thus, unequal treaties and trading rights were profitable, raising a multi-million man army and committing it to the far side of the world (much farther than India) was not. \\n TL;DR too expensive. \\n',\n  0),\n ('I will look for primary sources regarding British logic; however, it seems to reflect a consensus among Colonial powers.  It was formally called the Open Door Policy after 1899, in which different powers agreed to respect the spheres of influence the other, competing powers had carved out. \\n I\\'m not an expert on British history, or how they chose their targets.  Speaking broadly, the acquisitions in China were commercially motivated.  Ports providing good trade access and trading rights in commercially important cities were the primary goal.  Britain and other colonial powers did occupy much of the Chinese coast, or at least the main cities, and expanded their sphere from there.  It is possible that the British and other powers simply realized that subjugating China would take a long time and a lot of manpower, and simply divvied up the task, settling for occupying coastal cities in the short run, and would have eventually occupied the whole of China if the 1911 revolution and all possible subsequent attempts failed, there was no WWI, and so forth.  The Japanese certainly would have succeeded eventually, given those conditions. \\n Japan and Korea were not left alone; however, they are NOT lands of vast resource wealth.  Neither was China, for that matter.  Japan and Korea and incredibly poor in natural resources, and the lack of oil and raw materials drove Japanese expansionism (and forced their attack on the US, as the US controlled the Philippines and the associated oil fields).  The material wealth that the Europeans desired had largely already been extracted by the Chinese over the last few thousand years, and the treaties and wars gave them plenty of opportunities to simply have the Qing collect it for them.  There was no natural resource wealth the Europeans were aware of that could be acquired under their control, but not traded for at cut-rate prices under local control (cost of administration + extraction > cost of buying). \\n Korea was occupied by Japan, an Imperial power.  Geographically, Russia was the only European power likely to contest, and even with the Trans-Siberian railroad, Russia at the time was too weak to forcibly occupy Korea (they might have had a window of opportunity, but the Japanese closed it quickly, and replaced Russia as the dominant power in Northeast Asia).  Again, if America or Britain wanted to invade and completely dominate Japan or Korea, it would be a massive expenditure, and unlikely to be supported at home unless there was major gain to be had.  Japan is geographically larger and more populous than most European nations, and extremely far removed from centers of European power.  Ditto China. \\n So, while China was fractured and weak enough to be slowly conquered by the combined forces of Europe and Japan over a long period of time, there was simply not enough time.  The British East India Company began settling India in 1608, and controlled most of India by 1858- and Britain NEVER completely occupied India, ruling through Princely States, and not touching the countryside.  That was nearly 250 years- starting from 1839, the British would still be subduing renegade provinces right now.  However, it is not a fair comparison- aggressive expansion in India didn\\'t get started until around 1800.  Nevertheless, the size and population of China would mean a long, hard road for any conquerer trying to control the whole land mass.  Add in the logistics, and it would be a nightmare lasting generations.  There was simply no feasible way to do it before WWI and technological advances paid put to the age of European empires- though possible in \"What if?“ scenarios that give Britain and Japan another 100 years to expand, without the 1911 revolution/Communist revolutions taking places. \\n Japan was a similar story- too far away and too strong and too worthless to go for a massive land invasion, when a show of force in Tokyo Bay and some easy negotiations got expansionist America and European powers what they wanted.  If Britain had changed its mind, Japan was still modernizing too fast.  Japan manhandled Russia in 1905, claimed Korea as a prize, and was far too strong to be worth colonizing for any European power after that.  Even if Britain wanted to occupy them, it would be a Pyrrhic victory.  The cost of a war of total conquest and occupation on the other side of the globe was and is pretty damn high, especially against a centralized state with a modern military.  Korea was small enough to be a prize, and it was snapped up from China by Japan, not Russia. \\n TL;DR  Not weird at all they didn\\'t get conquered.  Not worthwhile or practical in the short run.

Political decentralization which robbed the national government of any power save over the army, and military decentralization which created sectionalist militias to counteract the national army, doomed attempts to maintain a national unity. \\n tl,dr: I would not say that the West was integral to the breakup of the Yugoslavian confederation. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"It depends on what sort of Historian you ask. A whig historian would probably say yes, though as has been stated in the excellent first comment they are few and far between. \\n To give a very brief Marxist historical perspective (though I don't claim to be an expert in that area): Economic Base theory states that societies are determined by their modes of production. This combined with historical, dialectic materialist theories (the Marxist for of Hegelian dialectics) suggests that societies DO progress in a roughly linear fashion but that the direction is NOT morally based but rather based on efficiency and productive capability. In simple terms societies become more economically powerful over time, which may well include an increase in negative freedoms, but that these are due to market pressures rather than moral progress as you phrased it. \\n Similarly base and superstructure theory states that public morality and legal rights are part of the superstructure and as such are dependent entirely on economic relations and thus cannot be viewed as anything other than a result of economics, though the theory does also state that base and superstructure are mutually reciprocal and perpetuate one another. \\n tl;dr: Marxist theory would suggest perceived moral progress is a side effect of the Hegelian progress of society, primarily economic progress. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"The conclusion I often see made on this topic (and which has been given lip service in this thread already) is that it is a by design way to sell products, and an entirely arbitrary desire.

As a result, (relative) hairlessness is an implicitly feminine feature.

This leads to two other possible explanations: \\n \\n (1) It is possible that there was some kind of selective pressure for this trait, and beauty ideals concerning body hair stem from an innate underlying attraction to hairlessness. \\n \\n (2) That wherever there is a trait, there is a cultural preference. And the desire for hairless women over hairy women is no more significant than the fetishization of blonde hair over brown. \\n \\n \\n Normally I would not make such a broad appeal to the mysteries of natural selection, since that is such a can of worms. But since men  are  in fact hairier than women, the assertion that there may have been a selective pressure concerning body hair is not entirely baseless. \\n Going down the line humans are far less hairy than our pre-homosapien ancestors, so the amount of body hair a species has very probably had a significant effect on selection. And if it can have an effect on species selection, it is perfectly possible that it could be beneficial to one gender and less so to the other within the same species. \\n TL;DR Almost certainly the  practice  of shaving body hair is a result of marketing and cultural pressure, but I am not sure it is fair to conclude that the attraction to that trait is entirely artificial. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('I can certainly expand: it\\'s not true. That is to say: the site Schliemann dug through is certainly Troy, but it\\'s not true that everyone before him agreed that it was a fictional place. Schliemann  claimed  that everyone thought it was a mythical place: this was to support his PR efforts, and make it look like he was battling against some entrenched view. He wasn\\'t. \\n In reality the site was always known to be the location of Greco-Roman Ilion/Ilium, and it was generally accepted to be the setting of the mythical Trojan War. A few people prior to Schliemann had expressed doubts about whether it actually made sense to equate the physical site with the mythical place, but on the whole people have generally been willing to identify the site as \"the Troy of the Trojan War\" in the same sense that they identify Thebes with \"Oedipus\\' Thebes\". Contrary to what Schliemann wanted everyone to think, it\\'s really pretty normal for myths to be set in real places. \\n In fact there\\'s probably more resistance  now  to the identification of Troy with \"mythical Troy\" than there was prior to Schliemann. People are still expressing serious doubts as to the importance of the Bronze Age site, its identification, and so on. But not many people doubt that the site is the same as the one that 7th-century-BCE Greeks knew as \"Ilios\", and I don\\'t suppose anyone would deny that Ilios is where the 7th-century-BCE Greeks considered the Trojan War to have taken place. \\n Now, Schliemann also put a great deal of work into conflating  the existence of Troy  with  the historicity of the Trojan War . That\\'s a separate matter. Not many ancient historians do actually believe in a historical Trojan War in any very meaningful sense, but there are some very notable exceptions.

Isolated references to otherwise unattested peoples, places, and so on are pretty much par for the course in the Bronze Age.

If that were the case then we would never have witnessed the Good Friday Agreement. Anyhoo, I digress. This is going to be the  very brief version . \\n Beginning in 1169 the Normans (\"English\") began colonizing Ireland. In the 17th century the English, in an attempt to curb Irish resistance, began a processes known as Plantations in which Scottish and some English settlers were transplanted to Ireland. This primarily took place in the north, Ulster. A few more centuries of conflict and we get to the 1800 Act of Union which merged Ireland with Great Britain. By the end of the 19th century Ireland was predominately separated as Protestant in the north (due to economic development, particularly surrounding linen and shipping industries around Belfast) and Catholic throughout the rest of the island. Several failed Home Rule bills later and in 1916 the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Republican Brotherhood staged the Easter Uprising. This failed but led into the Anglo-Irish War, which eventually led to the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty: this established a form of Irish Home Rule but separated the Protestant north from the rest of Ireland. A Civil War ensued but the pro-treaty forces eventually prevailed. In 1969 the Bogside Riots in Northern Ireland (among other issues) led to the Troubles, a period of intense conflict between Nationalists fighting against British occupation and Unionists supporting a strong British presence in Northern Ireland. The 1998 Good Friday Agreement essentially ended the Troubles and has led, with a few bumps along the way, to a joint Catholic-Protestant government. Popular elections could lead to the North joining the Republic but as of now there is a rough 60-40 split. \\n VERY TL:DR - Northern Irish Nationalists view the English as colonists and oppressors, but the English and Irish Unionists don\\'t see themselves as such. \\n Does this answer your question?

As a rough rule of thumb about the chances of becoming an academic, look around at the other students in your history courses. How many would like to become an academic,  do some research, write books etc? Now look at how many of the staff are retiring this year.

If the department  are not interested, you and a group of like-minded friends could try luring a few post-grads to lunch with you or something. You can learn how their future looks to them. \\n What alternative routes are there to where you want to go? You could maybe aim at a writing career, specialising in History. One of  the things you will learn on writing courses is how few people find they can support themselves on writing books alone. You will need to look at how you can earn your basic bread and butter. \\n A third route is to become a school teacher.

The first attestation we have of a language that could be called 'German' is  Old High German  is very little in English, mostly loanwords relating to arts and sciences. \\n French, meanwhile, is not a Germanic language and  did  heavily influence English; there is a huge number of French loanwords in English, mostly dating from the Middle English period, and English grammar went through a period of considerable simplification in the centuries following the Norman Conquest of 1066 (the Early Middle English phase). The ways in which grammar changed are a bit too complicated to go through here, but suffice it to say that a great deal of complexity in the endings of nouns (nominative/accusative/dative/genitive) was lost, with the first three merging to a bare noun and the last taking the sole form /-s/. Similar things happened with the verbs and syntax, but that would take a long time to get to and isn't the question you asked. Just wanted to clear those two up. \\n You correctly point out that both French and Germanic (other than English, obviously) have noun gender as a rule. This helps to show us, I think - and this is a somewhat contentious point, but one I and several scholars think is supported by the evidence - that it wasn't the influence of Norman French that caused noun gender to disappear from Middle English, but the change was part of the natural development in English itself. \\n One quirky feature of Standard German is that you're  supposed  to use the same gender in a pronoun as the noun it refers to - so, for example, the translation of 'the girl, I saw her' would be  Das Mädchen, ich habe -es- gesehen  - literally 'it'. That's because the antecedent, 'Mädchen', is a neuter noun, contrary to its natural gender (if you're wondering, this is because the  -chen  suffix is always neuter). Now, that's the standard formal way of speaking, but in practice you'll find a lot of Germans saying  das Mädchen... sie , 'she', especially when the pronoun is a long way away from the antecedent / in a different sentence. \\n In Old English, however, this tendency was already being lost, even in the same sentence, even when the nouns were near to each other. Thus in an Old English bible translation Jesus says  þisne hlaf, -hit- is min lichama , 'this bread, -it- is my body' - even though  hlaf , 'bread', is grammatically masculine. This shows that even before the Norman Conquest English was losing some sense of what grammatical gender applied to exactly, and was moving toward natural gender. \\n Why did this happen in English, say, and not in German? Well, it's very difficult to know with linguistics 'why' something happens - there are rules that show that something's gonna be more  likely  (for example, Old English speakers wouldn't have made  hlaf  feminine by this process), but in reality the changes Old English experienced in the generational transitions to Middle English were pretty much idiosyncratic, and difficult to reduce to historical terms (although note that the loss of gender isn't unprecedented in Indo-European - Persian did the exact same thing, Danish, Swedish and Norwegian merged the masculine and feminine, and Romance languages lost the neuter). I'd be wary, as such, of the idea that something 'caused' English to lose its gender, since the convergence of causes is very complicated and occurs in the minds of the speakers rather than as an objective historical fact. \\n TL;DR  neither French nor Germanic languages caused English to lose its system of gender - we already see hints of it in Old English, and it was part of a general grammatical levelling in Middle English which can't be attributed directly to Norman French despite the timeframe.

One of the world\\'s oldest civilizations has never officially adorned a religious belief. Chinese culture and history has always revolved around lifestyles instead of beliefs, and one of the most prevailing and dominant values of Chinese culture is that you don\\'t mind other people\\'s beliefs, and they don\\'t mind yours. This value makes it particularly difficult to spread any idea that would fit the classical definition of a \"religion\". \\n In the height of Confucianism (a school of thought, not a religion, founded by an actual man named Kong Zi, anglicized as Confucius), this tenet was taught by him as something along the lines of \"mind your own doorstep, but do not disturb your neighbours\\'.\". This summarizes the cultural practices of China, and is one of the prime reasons not a single religion has been adopted to a significant level. \\n Of course, religion exists there. There are Chinese Muslims, Chinese Christians, Chinese Jews, etc. But as a national and cultural entity, their stance on such things has always been non-existent. God does not play any kind of a role in daily life for the majority of people, not because everyone is opposed to it, but because it\\'s recognized as a quaint and interesting idea, nothing more. I\\'m not quite sure China even has an official stance on religion, as historically the notion of having a god or gods is primarily a non-Asian thing (not including India). \\n As for Buddhism, it adheres mostly to what I\\'ve said before. Buddhism, at the core of it, is much more about self-improvement and a lifestyle than the worship of something / someone. I personally think that Buddhism blurs the line between being a religion and a cultural practice, but even if you do consider it a religion, China as a whole has never officially identified itself with it. \\n This, of course, plays a role in the rest of Asia as well. While Korea has embraced Christianity more than its neighbours, that is a very recent development in the scope of history. Countries like Korea and Japan have been more about the cycle of life vs. the belief of a religion. Cultural superstitions, which have ancestral origins, are more easily found than the idea of a creator. \\n TL;DR  China, and due to its influence, other major Far East Asian countries as well, because of a prevalent \"mind your own business\" attitude. Mythology, superstition, and \"ancestral wisdom\" is more commonly found there. Religion never really came about over there for the same reason an idea like Feng Shui has never come about in the West. \\n Source : I grew up over there.

Originally it referred to the power of the roman kings. After the reign of kings the word changed to mean the power given to consuls and magistrates. As Rome began to expand it changed to mean all that Rome controlled. The word generally becomes intangible, it can mean many things and has no related size, government, economic or religious requirement. I can say my home and property are my empire, I can have a business empire, a crime empire etc... it just gives a sense of grander and power, a sense of authority and control. \\n So, with that out of the way and a much simpler answer. Some (many?) historians will settle on Sargon's Akkadian Empire as the first empire. \\n Sargon was the cup-bearer to the king of Kish. He had a dream about the death of king and warned the king about the dream. The king tried to have Sargon killed multiple times out of fear and eventually Sargon read an assassination request for his own death... history goes dark here but picks up in 2334 B.C.E when Sargon lead a rebellion on the king of Kish and won. After that he very quickly took the city of Uruk and started his reign as king and moved his capitol to the city of Akkad. \\n Akkad is a kind of mythic city, we can't find it, we know it existed, it was the center of his kingdom and eventual empire. The city had a river port and was the main point of trade for the region. Like all great city's, Sargon brought in the best artists and architects of his day and made a city worthy of being the capitol of his domain. \\n After moving to Akkad, Sargon started to expand.  First he took the rest of the Sumerian city's and towns. He then took the city/realm of Elam and then went north to take Simmurum. This secured two his flanks and he was now free to move on the powerful city of Mari. After taking Mari, he then went north and sacked the city of Ebla, he also concurred the area.  My notes say that it's suggested he also lead a campaign further north in a raid/anti-raid to protect his trade routes but regardless of that, with the conquest of Elba Sargon controlled an empire. He had stabiltiy and his children ruled for at least two generations and my notes on Sargon end here. \\n sorry if this is a mess, my notes are sketchy at best and don't really have many dates (other then birth and death dates for some people). \\n TL:DR : The Akkadian Empire, founded by Sargon (2334–2279 BC) \\n ^edits ^for ^clarity, ^I ^can't ^grammar \\n\",\n  0),\n ('According to the Biblical account, it was the religious leaders in the Jewish community that for years pressured the Roman government to crucify Jesus.

But, since there had already recently been an uprising, and because Pilate wanted to avoid another one (at this point, the people had also turned against Jesus and were calling for his death along with the religious leaders), he allowed the crucifiction to take place. \\n TL/DR technically no. \\n',\n  0),\n ('(Much of this is rearranged info from another thread, but there are some additions as well) \\n There have been many inflection points for papal power over the position\\'s long history.  The pope used to rule a temporal state, much as a king ruled their territory.  This ended in 1861, when the Italian peninsula was unified.  In 1870, the pontiff lost control of Rome (previously, he was protected by France\\'s Napoleon III.  This ended when France needed its troops for the Franco-Prussian war, and since they lost the war the troops did not return to Rome) and that historic city became the capital of Italy. \\n After that, the Vatican was in an uncertain state (or a state of limbo, if you will allow for a bit of humor in my answer).  The popes considered themselves much like prisoners and there was no codification of the Vatican\\'s temporal situation.  It had lost the vast majority of its territory, but to keep the head of one of the world\\'s largest religions was an untenable situation (though I must admit that it persisted for nearly 69 years...) \\n The Lateran Concordat (or Lateran Accords, or Lateran Treaties) was signed in 1929. It is still in effect today. A Concordat is a bilateral treaty between the Vatican and another state.  (another Concordat that is of interest to historians is the Reichskonkordat signed in 1933 between the Vatican and Hitler\\'s Germany) In the case of the Lateran Concordat, the second party was Mussolini\\'s Italy. This treaty acknowledges the Vatican as a soverign nation and establishes its territorial boundries. It also required strict neutrality by the Vatican in foreign affairs. It did allow the Vatican to speak on moral and spiritual issues. Of course, the Pontiff is also the Bishop of Rome, and has considerable but not absolute power in the Catholic Church. \\n José M. Sánchez, author of The Spanish Civil War as a Religious Tragedy, gives an excellent overview of the limits of papal power.\\n\"whatever the pretensions of papal power, the fact is that the pope is a human being, the Vatican is a state, the Holy See is a diplomatic institution, and all of them are subject to the limitations inherent in their condition\" \\n He also asserts that the pope has \"two limitations of knowledge and influence [that] weigh heavily on any decision the pope makes: he must ask himself if his sources are reliable and he must act with the constant apprehension that his words will not be heeded; or worse, that he will be disobeyed and the disobedience itself may lead to schism\" \\n Also, the pontiff \"has power and influence only over believers; and believers can quickly become unbelievers if pressed to do something to which they object...There is a fine line between justice and prudence, and the popes have usually erred on the side of prudence\" \\n Each of the above quotes comes from page 118 of Tragedy. On page 122, he contrasts the policies of other nations with those of the Vatican in the 1930\\'s. \\n \"Generally, national heirarchies tended to adopt political (and hence short-range) stances to problems, while the papacy was more interested in social solutions (and hence long-range attitudes).\" \\n So, what does all this mean? The pope is a head of state (albiet a very small one), and he has all the rights and limitations that go with that position. He has diplomats around the globe, in the form of papal nuncios and other staff. These people function in the same manner as ambassadors and diplomats of any other nation, and are afforded the same legal rights and restrictions as any others. \\n Regarding the point on schism, the Church as an institution avoids the chance of a split with fervor. With the Orthodox/Roman split and the Protestant/Catholic split among others, the pope is highly reluctant to do anything that will cause further schism. There is an underlying current of resolution to not push people out of the tent, so to speak. There is also an aversion to force members to decide between their own convictions and those of the Church. The idea behind this is that if you can keep your members in the tent, you can continue to influence them and bring them to agree with you and work on their salvation. \\n As to the short-term vs long-term, the idea that \"the Catholic Church thinks in centuries\" is useful. Even in dealing in diplomatic situations, the Holy See is more likely to take the long view than to search for expediency. \\n Most of the above deals with the pope\\'s temporal power. In a spiritual sense, the pontiff is a leader but is not an autocrat. Realistically, he can influence, cajole, teach, preach, moralize, and beg. What he cannot do is force. This is less a de jure limitation and more of a cultural position. With the institutional concern about schism, the pope will almost always avoid forcing a decision. If you grant that the pope is at least partially concerned with eternity, then taking the long view on a current problem makes more sense than some sort of showdown. \\n Conclusions \\n My expertise is limited to the papacy after the Lateran Concordat of 1929, though I have some knowledge of earlier history.  After that treaty, the pope was (and is) limited as a head of state to neutrality in foreign affairs.  His diplomatic skill, and those of his diplomats, is how the pontiff can influence other nations directly.  The papacy is likely to take a long-term approach to most issues it faces, and is unlikely to force a confrontation or decision due to an institutional aversion to schism. \\n TLDR: since 1929, The pope is a head of state. He is also the head of a religion, but he can only guide his followers, because he fears schism he is very unlikely to force a decision on any particular issue and is more likely to try to use his influence to \"win\" in the long run. \\n If there are any questions on specifics or any other items I can address, please let me know. \\n EDITED TO ADD: \\n Here is a link to the full text of the [Lateran Concordat]( in english. \\n',\n  0),\n ('I can give basic reasons for those questions, although if your looking for something more in depth, you may want to wait for an actual historian on here to give you an answer. \\n A halftrack is simply cross between a truck with the two wheels, typically at the front, for steering and the tracks at the back to give it grip when crossing rough terrain. \\nThe advantages it gave over a Bren Carrier or a Kangaroo is simply the ease of mobility.

The Lyceum circuit dies out by the Civil War, and Barnum’s American Museum burns down, though the sideshow survive. \\n And then there was the rise of the World’s Fairs. \\n There were the largest, most spectacular events of the 19th century, with the largest attendances. There was no single fair; instead there was a vast network spread over host cities, as expos or exhibitions. These were the origins of modern amusement parts, like Coney Island or Disneyland. MILLIONS and MILLIONS of people attended them. \\n The WFs featured amusements. As well as having rides and all that, they had “natural wonders” and exotica, and “primitive peoples.” They would build entire fake villages into them, and they would have everything from vanishing peoples or international recreations of cities. These fairs spoke on two channels: one of exotica and racialized others, and the other on Western science, engineering and industrial capitalism that showed off arts, crafts, and goods. It contrasted how advanced the Western world is compared to the “primitiveness” of the “other.” \\n These fairs became staging grounds for various positions about race, civilization, capitalism, empire, and technological progress. Ordinary people were taught about these things here. This all performed a hegemonic function: it immersed people in this symbolic universe that forged a consensus among people what progress looks like. \\n According to the fairs, progress was economic growth + material plenty + racial dominance. It never said that on a sign anywhere, obviously, but it was communicated by the logic and displays of the fair itself. Everything they encountered was a narrative of industrial process/plenty, and the contrast of the “other” being racially dominated, primitive peoples. \\n The first World Fair was in 1851 at the Crystal Palace in London. The purpose was to display the industrial, economic and military power of the British Empire, and it juxtaposed the British “achievements” with the colonial others. By putting them side-by-side, they highlighted their own “progress.” The fairs were steeped in Orientalism: it didn\\'t just transplant peoples, it  manufactured  these exotic “others”. And science doesn\\'t get off the hook here, either, there was a deep involvement of anthropologists, historians, philosophers and other experts to authenticate the colonial subjects on display. For the most part, these \"anthropologists\" literally did not know what they were talking about, as they had never been to these places, ever! They just got to look like experts and get paid for it, and in turn, authenticate these orientalist fantasy worlds. \\n Fairs often had sexualized nudity, such as “scenes from a Tunisian harem” –– it was meant to titillate viewers. These representations say nothing real about colonial subjects, instead they reveal complex sexualized and racialized DESIRES of the fair organizers. Nineteenth century anthropology depended on fairs to get funding, and fairs dependent on anthropologists for their materials, and it all created a big mess of manufactured misrepresentations. They also depended on circuses, zoological gardens, and other displays. Colonial subjects would often travel to fairs as contract labor, too in some instances in indentured servitude, but not necessarily. \\n (And this is IMPORTANT: we need a nuanced understanding of power, and we must be careful not to erase the agency of colonial subjects, who made a living off of the fantasy work they were asked to do. They were willing to act out these racialized fantasies as a career. Venturing to fairs was dangerous, exciting and potentially highly profitable. Many attracted regular fans, had local romances, and became minor stars. Many came willingly as contracted workers to act this out, even if they weren\\'t necessarily completely informed from the beginning. They were paid to represent an entire race, and to act out the fantasies of fair organizers and their white viewers.) \\n So: fairs were a tremendous role in mass education, they played a role in disseminating ideas about racial and sexual otherness, “progress”, and civilization. \\n SHUT UP ABOUT POP CULTURE PLEASE AND TALK ABOUT DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS \\n I\\'m getting tired of typing so here\\'s another example of what I meant when I was talking about new forms of science to justify \"who gets to be a citizen\" and whatnot. Over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries, Europeans came to believe that they had acquired an understanding of the workings of the physical world, or some sort of ability to tap into its natural and human resources. Europeans explored and colonized Africa and the Americas, and the Pacific. They encountered thousands of new animals, plants, minerals, and as well as local and indigenous knowledges. This chain of \"Travel, extraction, transplant, profit\" goes on here, and with this emerges a wealth of new objects and information, creating a demand for new types of order, and it came with a classical zeal: a lust to know everything. \\n What is all of this stuff?  It needs a name! \\n In many ways, the enlightenment becomes the “Great Extraction.” \\n Over the 19thc and early 20thc, this knowing everything gets mobilized as the evidentiary base by which Europeans then claim superiority over others. As much as this is learning, it’s also forgetting: some sort of strange “amnesia” about where things come from. We still say this kind of stuff today: \"new animal discovered\" when those things are technically already known by indigenous peoples, but it\\'s new to us, so we suggest it\\'s new overall. People would collect things and generate information about it, but then psych themselves up about how they know everything and are the scientific/academic center of the universe. This creates a global hegemony, as evidence of their own superiority and dominance over the field of knowledge. \\n So 19thc European observers (travelers, scientists, explorers, writers) getting deeper into Africa began to say that African cultures were devoid of all scientific thinking, and possessed only the most primitive technology. It was entirely a comparative matter: “They don’t have machines, or complicated tools or anything, so they’re not like us, and we are civilized so they are not civilized.” They measure all of these other places against themselves. “They don’t have this highly professionalized and specialized “modern” word like we do, therefore they are inferior to us.” There was the assertion that Africans had not been responsible for a single “discovery” of “mechanical invention.” \\n “You don’t seem to have discovered ANYTHING\" is a self-reinforcing narrative. The first president of the Anthropological Society in London challenged those who argued for African equality at the time to name one African who had distinguished himself in any field of science. “Until you can do that, the evidence is there.” \\n They chose to forget where their knowledge came from, and who they got it from. \\n And colonizing interests amplified this further by drawing on ideas like recapitulation theories; present-day African societies were seen as living examples of an evolutionary stage that Europeans had passed through millennia earlier. Often said: living and work among African people was like going “thousands of years into the past.” \\n This Western discourse about African cultures also required the un-makings of other knowledge and evidence. Meaning: there was a collective denial that any accomplishments found within Africa were the product of black Africans. They would find a way to re-narrate it in their minds: “Anything sophisticated thing we see CANNOT be the result of black Africans. Maybe it was a non-black African. Maybe someone else came, showed them, and left! Yeah, that’s it.” This is largely why you hear a lot of stuff about how the Egyptians could not have built the pyramids, or you never hear about great African kingdoms or whatever in mainstream knowledge of African history: there has been this big narrative designed to erase African accomplishment in favour of this idea of primitiveness. \\n For instance: (1850s) American and European experts outright rejected that black Africans had any role whatsoever in Egyptian civilization. “Maybe they were laborers or something.” \\n Ancient ruins in what would become the British colony of Southern Rhodesia:  “Their extent, their gigantic proportions, and their general plan indicate a loftiness of conception very far superior to the present ability of the Negro race.” \\n I\\'m tired of talking now. \\n But you get the idea. \\n TL;DR: Political changes demanded a new social hierarchy, new scientific inquiry was mobilized to accommodate this new social hierarchy, this same scientific knowledge and the dissemination of that knowledge resulted in the rise of popular culture attitudes about race… as well as cultures of classification just going nuts.  And again, I have to stress this is about biological racism and not just \"different cultures being dicks to each other\" because that\\'s a thing that happens allllllll throughout history. \\n I\\'m tired. \\n Give me a few minutes to assemble a bibliography. \\n (I am also sorry for how Jared Diamond I can be.) \\n EDIT:  SOrry for formatting, wrote it up in Pages and forgot that Reddit is not down with paragraph indentations.

Through subterfuge and tactical friendships, the British gained a firm foothold in India and cobbled together a \"country\", similar in shape and size to the geopolitical landmass we refer to today as the Indian subcontinent. \\n The East India Company was formally dissolved in 1857 and all its properties were ceded to the Queen.\\nAfter another 90 years of Crown rule, during which the British had further reshaped and mutilated \"India\", independence was granted and, at the stroke of the midnight hour on August 15th, 1947, independence was granted, to India and Pakistan both. \\n TL;DR: The British didn\\'t treat it as one entity to begin with, but eventually it became easier to administer it as one colony.

Hegel argues that human institutions, knowledge, concepts, cultures, ethics, rights and so on are not fixed, but evolve over time. Where other philosophers simply attempt to explain things as they are now, Hegel argues that we must qualify what we believe is truth with the knowledge that people in the past believed very different things were truth and were wrong, and that people in the future will likely believe very different things too, and think that WE are wrong. \\n Hegel believed it was possible to chart patterns in the historical development of ideas over time. He believed that by examining what people thought at different times in relation to each other he could discern the evolution of fields like ethics, politics, aesthetics and the sciences. Hegel believed that there were certain patterns to this development, and that overall the evolution of ideas was inherently positive, leading to upward progress of human knowledge and the human condition. While some moderns might take issue with the idea of eternally upward development in the age of nuclear weapons, pollution and with holocausts and world wars in recent memory, the idea of the change and evolution of ideas still holds. \\n Hegel is a friend of the Historian because he believes understanding the past is a deeply worthwhile effort even if he is largely skeptical of the idea that knowledge acquired from the past can be used to predict the future. While Hegel indulges in a number of predictions himself and believes that attempting to predict the future is important to moving progress forward, he claims that no policy maker ever did learn the lessons of the past, and would be the first to acknowledge that his own theories and patterns are no more inviolate than any others in that they are only true in their historical moment. \\n The second important thing Hegel provides the historian is a unique perspective of the relationship between the individual and society, a concept of crucial importance to any historian. In contrast to many of his contemporaries, who argued that human beings were autonomous, atomistic individuals who inevitably followed their own self-interest according to the principles of utilitarianism. Hegel argues that the individual is deeply enmeshed in social ideas. \\n For Hegel, simply stating that humans follow their self-interest is a gross oversimplification of human nature, as is Kant's idea of the categorical imperative on the other hand. For Hegel, human goals are complex and inherently defined by a human being's relationships with other human beings. For example, what I desire, believe to be true and enjoy might be completely different from another person from another place and time. For example, what a medieval Catholic European monk desired and believed to be true is very different from what a secular utilitarian in the eighteenth century. People are complex and want socially determined things like status, recognition, friendship, love, expression, property, power, beauty and intellectual achievement. For Hegel, the basic foundation of human society and all our ideas, indeed the thing that separates sentient from non-sentient beings is the recognition that other individuals are also conscious, the recognition of them as subject with desires that we ought to respect. When we treat other humans as objects that serve only to satisfy our desires, we oppress them, but also delude ourselves into thinking we are more powerful than we are, that we are immune from the need for recognition. From here comes Hegel's famous master-slave dialectic, crucial to understanding the idea of oppression and exploitation. \\n Hegel believed that to understand any person in any time period, one had to know what they were dealing with rather than apply a standard, universal rule of human behavior. One must trace what ideas they believed to be true, what language they spoke, what society they lived in, what form of government they lived under to truly understand what is going on. \\n This basic principle is crucial one for a historian. Understanding the status of women, the concept of the individual, the biases and interests of a given author, politics and so on in history requires us to examine the ideas, institutions and culture present at that time. \\n Hegel is certainly not an easy read, so much of what we know of him is filtered through different sources. For example, a great deal of thinkers were extremely hostile to Hegel and have largely succeeded in casting him as everything from so obscure as to be meaningless to the arch-philosopher of totalitarianism. On the other hand, Marx, another thinker deeply concerned with history, adapted Hegel to create his own theory. Marx claimed to be completely and reforming Hegel's ideas, not overturning them and many of Marx's basic ideas about historical materialism have become fundamental to our understanding of history, making it difficult to untangle Marx's ideas from Hegel. Meanwhile, Nietzsche adopted a number of Hegelian ideas and moved in an entirely different direction than Marx, adding even more to the confusion.\\nToday, it is possible to find two writings about Hegel that seem to agree on almost nothing about him. Generally, you will find either existentialism/analytic philosophy sympathizing works that brand him as the creator of a modern-day-theology which entombd the individual into conformity and moreover perpetuated a white, male, Western discourse on the one hand and neo-Marxists who argue that Hegel was a genius who was the first to understand the true nature of history, society, human nature and ideas, but whose contribution has been sadly forgotten because it offends utilitarian and libertarian thought and because it's author wrote in dismally dense prose. \\n I tend towards the latter opinion, but it's certainly a bias. \\n TLDR: In my private, rambling opinion, Hegel is a valuable philosopher for historians to understand because of his ideas of the historicity of human knowledge, the relation between the individual and society and of the basic structure of human relations. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('If I can move slightly sideways from Britain, and give examples from her colony (Australia)?

Humphrey was one of the most liberal men to ever contend for the presidency. Read about his candidacy in 1960 or his speech on civil rights at the 1948 DNC. Additionally, Humphrey and other high ranking Democrats knew that Johnson was attempting to end the war in the Paris negotiations, negotiations deliberately sabotaged by Richard Nixon (though to what degree is up for debate). \\n In 1968 though, the more important issue is the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy. He was someone who could bridge the gap between the \"Old Left\" of unions and big city bosses and the \"New Left\" of anti-war college students. I doubt that he would have let himself be hamstrung by an anti-war plank either though. In the frame of 1968, it\\'s an incredibly constricting plank for anyone of any stripe trying to avoid the the potential they would end up as Truman was perceived then, as having \"lost\" China and North Korea to the communists (this understandable fear was a large part of LBJ\\'s initial choice to intervene in Vietnam). \\n The utter contempt that the anti-war and New Left movements had for the party establishment was also a major factor in splitting the New Deal coalition. They helped to drive out the working class. First, they either could not or would not police their movement or gatherings well enough to keep people like Abbie Hoffman and the Yippies from causing major havoc (see  Pigasus . Second, I give them credit for initially trying to act within the system and nominate Eugene McCarthy, but when that failed, they acted like spoiled children. Plenty of people were happy to see Nixon win just to spite Humphrey, which if you\\'re even vaguely liberal is fucking insane. \\n This is not to completely absolve the Old Left, however, or to paint them as strictly victims. Between 1968 and 1972, the Democratic Party tried to reorganize itself under the leadership of George McGovern. While the New Left was contemptuous of including any of the old big city bosses or labor unions, the AFL-CIO boycotted the meetings outright and hence lost its position as a kingmaker. This was at the behest of AFL-CIO president George Meany. Then, during the election, Meany organized a vote of neutrality, despite the fact that McGovern had a virtually perfect rating from the AFL-CIO COPE (Committee on Political Education). \\n Lastly, Richard Nixon went out of his way to co-opt the working class. After 1968, he dropped his anti-union planks and went to work courting labor. He did this particularly well through Peter Brennan, who was head of the NYC Building Trades. Many in the working class, whose children did not go to college, and therefore didn\\'t get draft deferments, resented the fact that, in their opinion, spoiled, rich college kids were spitting on their opportunities by insulting professors and administrators, occupying and vandalizing buildings, etc. This led to what was known as the \"Hard Hat Riot\" when a bunch of construction workers in downtown Manhattan left their jobsite to go clobber antiwar protesters with wrenches and other heavy blunt objects. The long and short of it is that while Humphrey won labor by a huge percentage in 1968, Nixon won it in 1972. \\n TL;DR: Fuck the New Left and George Meany.

Certainly. \\n However, the reason Caesar\\'s enemies would drag him through the courts was far deeper than just him doing whatever he wanted to - Cato Minor, of course, used the war in Gaul as an excuse, but that was far from the only reason.

The main source of financing of cathedrals came from the local communities, lay and clerical, that commissioned them.  Remember that the rise of the great cathedrals from the late 12th century onward coincided with the rise of towns and the development of a new urban class—people who neither worked, prayed, nor fought, as the traditional medieval concept of the “three orders of society” had it, but people who made  money  as merchants, bankers, and tradesmen.  Cathedral building was a communal undertaking paid for by the contributions of the prosperous people of towns.  Cathedrals, in fact, were signs of civic pride.  Across much of Europe, towns competed to see who could build the most elaborate cathedral, which usually meant the tallest.  (This same mentality--is it phallocentric??--still lives as modern cities compete to see who has the tallest building: New York’s new World Trade Center? Chicago’s old Sears Tower? And the winner is . . . Dubai’s Burj Khalifa.)  You can see this civic pride at Chartres Cathedral where various trades commissioned stained glass windows depicting their trade.  Such sponsorship was both a mark of secular pride and pious devotion to God. \\n Even those townsfolk who weren’t rich could gain grace by making donations to cathedral building.  Yes, these donations won indulgences, but in the early days of cathedral building—the late 12th-14th centuries—selling indulgences had not yet reached the abusive levels that it would in the later Middle Ages.  In fact, very famously there are reports of upper- and lower-class people hauling stones in wagons as a pious act to help rebuild Chartres Cathedral in the late 12th century. \\n One other side of this: where cathedrals were attached to monasteries, these could use their vast landed wealth to help finance their building, as could the always powerful and wealthy bishops whose church the cathedral was. Most dioceses also demanded a small annual fee from everyone living in the diocese (which was a collection of dozens of parishes) for the upkeep of the cathedral, the “mother church” of the diocese.  Using income left as pious offerings at a cathedral’s shrines housing powerful relics of saints could also subsidize building.  Remember that cathedrals were the most impressive physical achievement of the Middle Ages; remember also that it typically took several generations from start to finish. (St. John the Divine in NYC was started in 1892; it’s still not finished.) \\n As for ordinary churches, by which I assume you mean the typical parish church, financing came overwhelmingly from the income from land, since about 90% of medieval people lived not in cities but the countryside.  Specifically I mean from tithes.  All parishioners were obliged to give annually 10% of their income (mostly agricultural products) to their parish church.  Parishioners were also obliged for the upkeep of the nave of the church, that area where they stood at Mass.  Their priest was responsible for the upkeep of the church’s chancel, where the main altar was.  In towns, parishes were established in neighborhoods.  There, folks were also obliged to tithe, but many of them were approaching what we would call “middle class,” so they had disposable wealth that they could invest in pious building.  The wealthiest of them could even build private chapels attached to their parish church. \\n TL,DR: Indulgences as we understand the term at the start of the 16th-century Reformation played a secondary role in building cathedrals and churches. \\n One good source: Robert A. Scott,  The Gothic Enterprise: A Guide to Understanding the Medieval Cathedral  (2005).  For parish churches a good summary is Richard Kieckhefer’s chapter “The Impact of Architecture” in  A People’s History of Christianity: Medieval Christianity  ed. Daniel E. Bornstein (2010). \\n Edit: One more thought.  One reason it could take generations to build a cathedral is that sometimes the building stalled when the money ran out due to whatever reasons.  Sometimes it took concerted effort to raise more money.  When angry townsfolk burned down Laon Cathedral  in 1122, the monks there took its relics on the road around the region to collection donations to rebuild it. \\n',\n  0),\n ('In pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, the issue of population density remains controversial, and I personally think densities and absolute numbers have tended to be exaggerated in some circles, for some areas. I am not qualified to say much about Mesoamerica outside of the Maya region, but I did recently look into this question for my dissertation. I went into it thinking that populations were pretty high, and came out of it basically convinced that there were not more than three million people in the whole Mayan-language-speaking region (roughly speaking, the Yucatan Peninsula, the lowlands of northern Guatemala and Belize, and the mountainous highlands of Guatemala and northern Honduras) at its pre-Hispanic population peak, around the eighth century A.D. That was just before the infamous \"Maya collapse\" and well before the Spanish Conquest. \\n The big problem is that, even though the lowland Classic Maya had a writing system and a well developed historical tradition, they did not record population numbers in any media that have survived to the present day. That means we have to turn to archaeology to address the question - and, to be sure, we\\'d want to use archaeology even if we had an ancient Maya census document, just to double check. Archaeologists use counts and densities of what are presumed to be residential structures as proxies for counts and densities of people: we use survey techniques (see below) to find as many structures as we can, assume X number of people per household, count the number of household units we think we see in the archaeological record, and voila! there\\'s your population. \\n Except that Classic Maya domestic structures tend to be arranged in clusters around a central patio, so does one building equal one household, or does one patio group equal one household? And since we have no documents telling us how many people tended to make up a \"household\" in ancient times, we have to rely on ethnographic accounts of post-contact Maya households in towns not yet transformed by the industrial age - and there, the numbers of people per household range from 3.8 to 25. One widely used estimate is an average of 5.4 people per household. But then you have to factor in whether all the structures you can detect are supposed to have been in use at once; a reasonable estimate is that about 10% were temporarily disused at any given time. And of course not all domestic structures were sleeping spaces, and there, estimates of how many structures in domestic compounds were non-residential range from 6.6% to 30%. Even worse, the Maya lowlands are a terrible place in which to try to find an average commoner\\'s 1300-year-old farmhouse. That house was probably made of wood and wattle-and-daub on top of a low platform of earth and unworked or roughly worked chunks of limestone, and now that there\\'s jungle all over everything, the remains are going to be a bit hard to detect. \\n These problems have led to some pretty divergent, and in my opinion sometimes highly inflated, population estimates. Let\\'s take as an example the city of Caracol, in modern-day Belize - one of the most politically powerful, and probably populous, Classic Maya cities, although not among the very most populous. Think of it as an ancient Maya Boston, not a New York. The archaeologists who have worked at Caracol for decades have long favored a  minimum  population for the city of 115,000 people in a 117 sq km area at its height, although they believe it was actually much higher, maybe around 150,000. They arrived at this number in the mid-1990s and have basically stuck with it since then. That estimate means a population density of about 651 people per square km in \"downtown\" Caracol, which is a little bit denser than Taiwan was in 2012. \\n Recently, they were able to use some grant money and newly available technology to conduct an aerial laser scan of the ground surface in their site area. The results of the scan are fantastic - 4,732 residential compounds (made up of multiple buildings) were detected in an area of 113 sq km. Many of these were not previously known about, so this technique (known as lidar, like radar with lasers) clearly delivers real results. The thing is, if you (1) assume that all the households were occupied at the same time and (2) multiply those 4,732 compounds by 5  people per household, you get 23,660 people, or a density of a little more than 209 people per sq km in that core area. Since probably not all domestic compounds were occupied at the same time, the actual numbers would likely have been a little lower. These numbers are in line with what the Basin of Mexico project (W. Sanders, J. Parsons, and R. Santley, 1979,  The Basin of Mexico: Ecological Processes in the Evolution of a Civilization.  Academic Press, New York) proposed as the absolute highest population density for Central Mexico under the Aztec Triple Alliance, just before the Spanish Conquest. \\n Now assume, optimistically, that the lidar survey only picked up half the households, and there are really more like 9,464 in the survey zone. That still only gets you to 64,355 people, or about 354 people per sq km. Given that the lidar almost certainly didn\\'t miss half the buildings in the survey zone, and given that they surveyed the densest part of the city (so that expanding the survey zone would give you diminishing returns in terms of the number of additional households you\\'d find), I think it\\'s safe to say that Greater Metropolitan Caracol, including its suburbs, was home to somewhere around 60,000 people at its absolute peak. \\n Well, so Caracol\\'s a pretty typical very-large-but-not-the-largest Classic Maya city. If we assume similar numbers for similarly sized cities, and correspondingly larger and smaller populations for larger and smaller cities, the maximum total population of the central and southern Maya lowlands at its peak in the eighth century A.D. would have been less than two million. David Webster, an archaeologist just retired from the University of Pennsylvania, favors a figure in the high hundreds of thousands, because he thinks the Classic Maya relied heavily on swidden agriculture; it was actually an essay of his that got me seriously thinking about this issue, and induced me to look at the Caracol data. Other scholars whose opinions on Maya agriculture I also respect believe that agricultural intensifications could have raised those numbers substantially. Still, you\\'re looking at not that much more than a million people when you take all the southern lowland cities into account, and adding the northern lowlands and the highlands probably doesn\\'t even get you to three million. (I think this is so because the northern Yucatan Peninsula is a pretty agriculturally marginal area that was never able to support as many metropoli at the same time as the southern lowlands were, even though some northern lowland cities, like Chichen Itza, were evidently very populous in their day.) \\n I expect to be challenged on these claims, and I should be, and I\\'ll post sources tomorrow as it\\'s getting pretty late where I am.

I can amend with sources in the morning. \\n First, it\\'s not really accurate to characterize the Center Party as a \"conservative\" party that \"favored Hitler over the communists.\"  In truth, its members ran the gamut from center left workers to hard right aristocrats.  (This was a legacy of Bismarck\\'s Kulturkampf, a major late nineteenth century anti-Catholic campaign that caused German Catholics from all walks of life to band together, despite widely varying outlooks.) \\n It\\'s true that the machinations of a Center Party member, Fritz von Papen, were instrumental in Hitler\\'s becoming Chancellor, but it must be noted he was expelled from the Center Party as a result.  (He caused the fall of another Center Party figure, von Bruning.) \\n The Center Party  did  provide the deciding votes for the Enabling Act, but this wasn\\'t so much a matter of the party siding with the Nazis as it was caving in to Nazi pressure, as did every other party save the Social Democrats/SPD.  (The Communists also would have voted against it, but they prevented from voting by virtue of being in jail.)  The Center Party was fiercely divided, however, with von Bruning saying something along that lines that a vote in favor of the act would sacrifice honor for safety, but in end would result in neither. \\n Also worth noting:  the SPD were actually the moderate left, not far left. \\n The party that did fit your description wasn\\'t the Center Party, but rather the far right German National People\\'s Party (DNVP).  The DNVP was a far right with its own paramilitary arm, the Stahlhelm, that was backed by businessman Alfred Hugenberg.  Hugenberg and von Papen attempted to use Hitler to offset their own electoral weakness.  Both served in Hitler\\'s cabinet, and both discovered in short order they had no real power to speak of. \\n (Von Papen gave a mildly critical speech, only to have his secretary murdered on the night of the long knives.  I\\'m not sure how long he retained his position, but he did nothing to rock the point from that point on.  He was also tried and acquitted at Nuremberg.) \\n As for Hindenburg, it\\'s more complicated than that.  He didn\\'t have any love the Weimar republic.  But he was also backed by the center and the left in the last presidential election.  (Not because they liked him -- they hated him -- but because his opponent was Hitler, and they wanted the Nazis from having both Chancellorship and Presidency.  Ultimately, of course, he died in office, and Hitler assumed his powers anyway.) \\n TLDR: Weimar politics are hugely complicated, and all of this is just scratching the surface.  Shit, I haven\\'t even mentioned Schleicher.... \\n Edit:  To offer a succinct answer to the actual question asked -- might as well at this point -- the Conservative politicians, most notably von Papen and Hugenberg, whose parliamentary maneuvering aided Hitler\\'s rise to power didn\\'t attempt to stage a coup when he marginalized them because they had no realistic means of doing so. \\n',\n  0),\n ('(Part 2/2) \\n This is where a major internal schism of Nazi Germany emerged. During the pre-war years, Germany was dominated by the Nazi party, but it was still technically in coalition with the various Centrist parties, and a number of Centrist ministers remained in influential positions. Hjalmar Schacht, the Chairman of the German Central Bank, was one of them. He implemented the policy of printed MEFO Bonds, or limited usage bonds, to finance German rearmament. MEFO bonds were a special type of currency that existed in large denominations that could only be used by approved industries in Germany, but still counted as legal tender (think of it like a $10,000,000 dollar bill that can only be used by automobile companies. If they catch a random person with it, it will be illegitimate, but if an approved industry uses it, it will be considered legal tender). This was done for two reasons: 1) to control inflation, and 2) to prevent the allies from realizing their massive deficit spending to rebuild their military. \\n Hjalmar Schacht later opposed German Rearmament beyond the peacetime necessity and was sidelined, along with a number of other ministers and generals in 1937, before the Anchluss and annexation of the Sudetenland. Curiously, he predicted that without free market reforms, the German economy will be unable to function properly and might default on its obligations without either 1) austerity (i.e. cutting back the military budget), 2) increased taxes (which would be politically damaging; the Nazi regime actually had incredibly modest taxes for most of the war), or 3) finding new sources of real currency to confiscate or otherwise inject into their economy. \\n On the last part, this follows the third German objective of achieving Lebensranum. Germany actually attacked many countries before it was ready largely out of the reality that it needed new sources of material gain to prevent financial ruin. It also used this time to exploit minorities, such as the Jews, by confiscating their assets and impressing them as slave labor. This also factored into the Anchluss and Sudetenland, as these were not only nationalist, military, and geopolitical objectives, but they were also economic objectives, as they not only incorporated industrial regions into the Reich, but also made neighboring countries economically dependent upon Germany. \\n TL;DR: Germany benefited from Hitlers policies in the Short-Run, but even without the war would have suffered long-term consequences. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"Sure is. In 1997 the Ohio historical society signed a lease with the country club to last until 2078.The public was invited to the Lunar Standstill u/Reedstilt is talking about that happens every 18.6 years and so we made the 250 mile pilgrimage out there. When we arrived we found that the event was canceled because the country club was worried that because it had been raining that people walking on the greens would ruin them. A bunch of native americans had come to pray also, and they weren't allowed in either. It was one of the more bizarre experiences I've had, that little town was a police state. There were police cars parked at every entrance, and driving around town police cars kept following us, probably because of our out of state plates. It was clear that if we tried to sneak in that night we would definitely have been arrested. Later that night there was some party at the country club, and while native americans weren't allowed to go and pray, ladies in high heels and drunk guys driving golf carts were indeed allowed on the greens. Its a national shame that a site that is a nominee for UNESCO status is the site of a golf course, and its disrespectful that they paved over some walls for golf cart paths and some of the other things they have done there. Sorry for the long story, I guess I'm still upset about what happened.

But it meant they would have made a lot of leeway when trying to point into the wind.

To invade the North risked involving stronger Communist powers into play. This started with deployment of American \"advisors\" who essentially trained ARVN (Army of the Republic of Viet Nam) soldiers, accompanied them on missions and played a support role in the South. True combat soldiers were eventually deployed in a defensive mission to protect air force bases from Viet Minh raids. \\n The problem became apparent that ARVN soldiers were not effectively repelling North forces. After suffering heavy casualties in numerous engagements with the North, desertion rates increased and overall morale plummeted. It\\'s important to note that ARVN soldiers were stereotyped for being ineffective and cowardly; already a poor reputation. Their suffering track record and string of heavy losses exacerbated the sense that the South was in fact losing the war. \\n General Westmoreland of the US rallied to turn the tide and stem the losses suffered in the South by making US involvement more open ended. He reasoned that US military strength existed primarily in its offensive capabilities because of the nature of US military schooling. His plan was to \"seize the initiative\" to destroy guerrilla and organized forces of the North (read: search & destroy). This phase of engagement would require the continued commitment of the US (keep giving us money, soldiers and weapons) and would end when the enemy was thrown on the defensive, exhausted, low on resources and unable to launch insurgent or organized attacks. (Read: go on the offense by seeking out enemy forces within South Vietnam, but don\\'t actually invade North Vietnam) \\n Essentially Westmoreland reasoned that US superiority in warfare technology and resources would eliminate more bodies than the North could replace. Part of his attrition strategy did also include recruitment strengthening in the South (primarily to discount another body for the North). American soldiers and technology would advance to wipe out the bulk of the North Vietnamese Army\\'s (NVA) organized forces and ARVN would be relegated to taking over defensive roles in the South and bolstering recruitment. Attrition was to be supported with heavy firepower and bombing that would in theory suppress enemy safeties and hiding spots. \\n Here; after all that explaining is why Body Count was the favored metric of success. The body count concept affirms Westmoreland\\'s strategy of attrition and gave tangible \"evidence\" of winning the war. The lack of fortified positions to take over in the brush of Vietnam and the extremely rugged nature of the terrain made it difficult to really say: \"this dense jungle is controlled by us\" or \"this air force base is now controlled by us\". However, Body Counts almost always sounded favorable to the US and gave the illusion that the US was winning. \\n Ultimately Body Counts proved to be problematic because of easy manipulation. Leadership would sometimes instruct forces to add innocents and civilians to the days body count. Pure inflating of the numbers reported also occurred. Morevoer, the North was able to control the rate at which they suffered losses by avoiding large scale confrontation by organized forces (which is what the US army excelled at). \\n I wont speculate as to whether or not attrition could have won the war for the US or even if it definitively lost it for them. That is an intensely debated topic today with many schools of thought arguing for or against. \\n However the tl;dr of your question about Body Counts is that Body Counts were used as (biased) evidence of the success of attrition. Attrition was chosen as the strategy in Vietnam because of the end goal of creating a strong buffer against the North, rather than all-out invasion. \\n I found George C.

Electric guitars were invented in 1952 by Les Paul, and though the first thing that could be considered a modern Synth existed in 1939, the first synthesizer that was actually on the market to be bought/used/played was the Moog in 1965. \\n So not only would you be expecting someone to adapt to a completely different type of rhythm alien to their culture, but you\\'d be expecting them comprehend instruments they hadn\\'t ever heard before.

After having tried and failed Emperor Charles V acknowledged that there was no more possible way to defeat the Protestants in Germany. At least this stopped religious wars until the ThirtyYears' War. \\nAfter this long and destructive war the  Peace of Westphalia (1648)  granted every German souvereign the right to choose the religion he wanted for himself and the subjects of his territory. If the ruler was Catholic, the people had to be Catholic and vice versa. \\nNot much later two very different movements helped to create a climate of tolerance in Germany: The Protestant movement of pietism and the enlightenment.  Pietism  underlines the importance of religious feeling which is a private thing and can't be regulated by dogmata.  Enlightement  of course was a rational movement. In Germany thinkers of the enlighenment mostly stayed Christian, but reduced the dogmata to an absolute minimum. They said all we can know is: There is a God and he judges us for our deeds and after death he rewards us or condemnates us for our lifestyle. And we know what's the right thing to do from our rationality. So there wasn't much left to fight about.\\nI guess thanks to those two movements we have this kind of tolerance today.\\nIt went a bit different in other countries, e.g. in France. Except for some time of tolerance for the hugenottes (the French Protestants) from 1598-1685 they  were brutally persecuted by the Catholic kings. But in the end enlightement led to the now famous laicism. \\n TL;DR : So to keep a long (hi)story short: I guess mainly the rationality of the enlightement and the pietistic trend to see religion as a private thing are the main causes of the tolerance between religions today. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"\\n pedantic \\n \\n Valid \\n \\n I would argue differently. \\n \\n \\n The rabble(i'm sorry if I offended anyone) weren't reading Marxist theories, the Aristocracy was.

Firstly, I'd like to say that I agree very much with Borimi's interpretation of the issue; we have always tried to maintain a balance between informality and rigour, and it needs to stay somewhere in the middle for the subreddit to keep people both informed  and  interested at the same time. We have discussed restricting responses to flaired users before and ended up squarely rejecting the idea as turning the subreddit into the internet equivalent of a stale digestive biscuit. \\n Before talking about anything else, in the kindest way possible I don't feel that this post understands all of the issues that the subreddit is experiencing right now. This is not because the OP is stupid, or anyone responding to the topic. But it's actually because you're reasonable human beings; none of you will read absolutely everything that is written in this subreddit, and why would you? In addition to topics that do not interest you, there will be plenty of times that people read the most useful response, find themselves informed and pleased and then move on. As moderators, we are constantly seeing everything that the subreddit is producing every single day. And that gives us a different view of what is going on in the subreddit. \\n To elaborate, I don't think changing the sidebar will do much of anything for the greater proportion of the subreddit. This is not to say I'm a fatalist- if we make a decision that we can make it more helpful by changing it, then we will! However, let me be very clear.  The majority of posts I end up having to moderate each day are by users that have ignored the sidebar . I try my best to not just be a naggy monitor, I will almost always explain why a post has been removed and direct people to quotes from the sidebar's guidelines if they are relevant. But nonetheless, a large portion of people who post do not read them; either they absorb the rules of the community from observing the behaviour of others, which is not unreasonable, or in several cases they don't care. This is by far the biggest difficulty we actually have in preserving the quality of the subreddit, and why there has been a sharp spike in the number of comments we are having to remove. We haven't changed the rules to be more strict, more people are breaking the pre-existing rules that we've operated under. \\n In addition, the subreddit is not the same beast. It's not the AskHistorians of 6 months ago. I think one way of concretely illustrating this is by pointing out a very common response to my moderation of posts; 'I didn't see I was posting in AskHistorians'. This is the kind of post I never, ever used to see made. But it illustrates what has changed; AskHistorians generates an immense amount of traffic and from different sources that means individual posts from here are showing up all over the Reddit site. In addition, many many people have subscribed to the subreddit and don't actually pay much attention to their feed. So many people assume that the rules of many subreddits are essentially the same, that they don't really have that instinct to stop and look at what subreddit they're in to make sure they don't get into trouble. You can bank on AskHistorians posts regularly showing up in subreddits such as DepthHub and Bestof now. This is a significant accolade, but it also means that posts are often being presented to people without context  and  it attracts a large number of subscriptions. It's not unheard of for us to get 1000 new subscribers in a few hours following a Bestof post. \\n Another part of us having emerged into a larger world is the unfortunate reality that we now attract voting brigades. Voting tallies have been radically altered due to attention from Depthub, Bestof, SRS, WhiteRights, SRD and probably from other interest groups that we aren't as aware of. \\n To cap this off, the growth of flaired users is exponentially smaller than the growth of the subreddit. We normally get around 5-10 new flaired users a week, and we grow by at least 100 subscribers most days. Every time a post elsewhere gets us 300-1000 extra new subscribers, it expands the gap even more. \\n However, do not misunderstand me as dismissing the points that this thread has raised. I think we probably can be clearer about what we consider an acceptable citation standard, that much is certain. As for methological dilemmas, controversies and approaches, I feel that we have actually had lots of discussion on these issues but in a very spread out way. Often, in order to explain a field I engage in properly, I have had to explain key arguments within the discipline, and I know I'm not the only one. Entire long posts have been made on the methological framework lying behind different areas of history and historical study, and differences between approaches. However, the difference to me seems like you want a more centralised discussion of these issues rather than having them spread across the subreddit. This is not unreasonable by any means. Out of interest, do you not include our weekly Meta topic relating to Methology to be related to this issue at all? \\n My response to your TL;DR is this. Conduct and appropriate ways of asking (and more importantly  answering ) questions are our main problems at the moment, because we are on the losing side of changes in demographics. In addition, we have always been focused on the insights that individual users bring to the table and not in using the subreddit as a mandated education tool. But those aside, I feel you have a point with regards to helping people evaluate sources, and also with several other issues I agree on. Remember, though, that to adequately explain these guidelines would take up a lot of space if placed on the sidebar directly. There are a certain number of things that  must  be linked to there, and ensuring proper conduct is the hardest task we have right now and we continue to prioritise that, even as we also try to expand the reach and depth of the subreddit. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('> show me some text demonstrating your point \\n This is a more difficult request to fulfill than I expected.

On the other hand, it is easy to become discouraged when you are making a good faith effort to be part of an engaging conversation, and refresh to see a huge swath of nuclear deletions, and your voice is lost in the cleansing. \\n \\n 2) The more subtle stuff is (obviously) less obvious. This is especially true where there are issues of subjective interpretation and misreading of tone and intent. As you, /u/AnOldHope, pointed out elsewhere in this thread, \\n >It just goes to show you that folks can have multiple readings of the same text. \\n Subtle or unintentional snobbery, through, is still damaging to the goal of the subreddit in being accessible to laypersons.

I don\\'t know, little attitude and culture things that lead to people feeling unwelcome in your community.

It is good policy and it should be upheld. But not everyone asks nicely, and (call me crazy, but) laypeople aren\\'t accustomed to accepting accusations of \"bullshit, back up your statement with fact\" as a friendly, non-aggressive way of furthering discussion. In everyday interaction, that\\'s a good way to shut down the whole conversation.  Being told \"provide sources or shut up\" just seems childish. (and yes, this happens). \\n Also, keep in mind that seeking and providing sources can be prohibitive and intimidating to a lay-user not well-versed in research. I keep thinking of those people who lose court battles despite having the law on their side. Unfamiliarity with the nuances of the system and lack of sufficient depth of knowledge = you\\'re fucked, and no one will help you. Fun times, friendly people. \\n THROWING THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATH WATER\" : Sometimes, even, when a source is provided, it isn\\'t  good enough  for the person demanding it. That\\'s okay, that may be true! Bad sources are plentiful. If it is handled well, it\\'s not an issue, but that doesn\\'t always happen. Often if you try and fail, you are summarily dismissed. No source or bad source seems to equal BAD USER, INPUT NOT VALID, and nothing you can say re-validates you. \\n I don\\'t know how to articulate or prove my point with this part, but I guess what I\\'m saying is that I have no idea how to source this, and this whole section is poorly written ......  so fuck my opinions and anecdotal evidence, right?  Even though my point may have merit. \\n AMATEUR EFFORTS SILENCED RATHER THAN BEING DISCUSSED/IMPROVED UPON:  I\\'m having trouble explaining this.

Our collection is based on Australian political history after Federation, and our collecting policy is based on an act of government, rather than say an art gallery whose collection policy is decided upon by a board/director/collecting managers. \\n When it comes to displaying objects, there are a few factors to consider. First, what are the higher-ups asking for? Often culturally significant anniversaries or government policy decisions can affect what will be displayed. For example, if it has been 100 years since the first Australian expedition to Antarctica, our directors may decide that it is important and necessary for our institution to develop an exhibition on the topic, using what is available in our collection. \\n The other factor is what gives the visitors and the audience a good idea of what your institution does and what it collects. For us, our permanent exhibition shows relevant examples of the complex and extensive collection, as well as objects that have captured the Australian imagination over the years. \\n It is important to consider preservation issues as well. Conservators are key in helping to decide how long an object can go on for and even if it can go on at all.

Most historians of medicine (my field) will tell you that there is no one definitive form of \\'medical doctor\\' in either the classical or Early Modern period. But I think we can provide some clarity. \\n From your question I\\'m going to infer that you are wondering, in part, the level of technical knowledge maintained by classical and Early Modern physicians; in other words, whether physicians were merely well-learned, as opposed to technically, or philosophically, sophisticated/specialized.  As you can’t really treat these periods together, I’ll address them separately. \\n Firstly, Rome.  We sometimes make the mistake of thinking that all classical philosophers were professional polymaths; that to be a good philosopher in ancient Greece or Rome you had to be a philosopher of  everything.   Aristotle is the archetype of this model: he wrote about ethics, taxonomy, botany, astronomy, politics, etc.  To be sure, philosophers from this time often cited earlier philosophers in their work, and in this sense there are analogies between Roman philosophical discourse and a liberal arts degree.  But Roman specialists did exist, many of whom conducted highly-specialized research, and some believed themselves to be engaged in a systematic investigation of the body and nature.  Consequently, they did develop a degree of technical and anatomical knowledge that transcended the disciplines of rhetoric, history, ethics etc. (i.e. the liberal arts).  Consider the most famous Roman physician: Galen. \\n Galen’s  On Prognosis  is perhaps his most famous work, and it is a real pleasure to read. Galen was a bombast – he loved to tout his mental acumen and social connectedness, but he also championed the superiority of his medical expertise.  Prognosis is full of practical knowledge. In particular, Galen discusses the diagnostic value of the pulse and urine.  In very Aristotelian fashion, Roman philosophers had developed a precise technical language for these kinds of diagnostics.  Urine, in particular, was analyzed through its color, viscosity, taste, sedimentation etc.  This kind of diagnostic work was exclusively the domain on the physician – and was acquired through years of practice. \\n The historian Maud Gleason demonstrates the specialization of Roman medical knowledge in her article “Shock and Awe: The Performative Dimension of Galen’s Anatomy of Demonstrations.” (in  Galen and the World of Knowledge , ed. Christopher Gill, Tim Whitmarsh, and John Wilkin. [Cambridge 2009]).  Gleason shows how Galen established his reputation through a series of well-attended anatomical demonstrations, during which he pointed out his novel observations of the body.  Whether or not Galen conducted these dissections himself (I’m inclined to believe he did) he demonstrated a profound knowledge of anatomy based on a study of corpses rather than books.  We’re definitely beyond the scope of liberal arts here. \\n It should also be pointed out that there was no real system of accreditation in ancient Rome.  One did not become a physician by going to school, or attending an academy.  One became a physicians by 1) having sufficient social standing; and 2) obtaining medical knowledge.  In this sense a liberal arts education facilitated, but did not define, the expertise of a physician. \\n Without going into too much more detail, other domains of knowledge in the which the Romans were expert included: materia medica (medicines), taxonomy, comparative (trans-species) anatomy, and dietetics. \\n Now for the Early Moderns.  17th century Europe is a totally different ball game from ancient Rome.  By this time the medical profession had split into dozens of branches, both regulated and unregulated.  For the purposes of this response we’ll concentrate on accredited physicians, which were definitely the least numerous (and arguably the least important) of the professional healers. \\n In contrast with the Romans, who did not license physicians, 17th-century men who wished to become a (reputable) physician had to attend university and receive a degree.  The 17th century medical curriculum was scholastic – by which I mean it emphasized rote memorization and rhetorical analysis of classical texts.  Aristotle and Hippocrates were, by far, the most important classical authorities.  Generally speaking, 17th-century medical students could expect little-to-no hands-on clinical experience as part of their curriculum.  To be a student of medicine was to be a student of texts and theory.  In this sense a modern liberal arts degree is highly comparable to the experiences of 17th-century medical students, though the subjects of study would differ greatly.  An early modern student’s course work, for example, would have a strong emphasis on theology.  (For further discussion of scholastic medicine, see: Vivian Nutton, “The Rise of Medical Humanism in Ferrarra, 1464-1555,”  Renaissance Studies  11 (1997): 1-19.) \\n That said, there are important differences between the liberal arts and early modern practice.  Firstly, during the 17th century medical education was in the midst of important changes.  In particular, the two most renowned medical universities of the day, Padua and Leiden (where Vesalius and Boerhaave worked, respectively) increasingly advocated the exposure of medical students to anatomical and clinical training.  By the early 1700s Edinburgh had established itself as a prominent medical university, largely on the basis of its robust clinical program. \\n Secondly, most men who received medical degrees in the 17th century did not go on to practice medicine.  Consequently, while there are similarities between a modern liberal arts education and an early modern medical degree, there is no necessary similarity with the early modern medical  profession.  Professional physicians exhibited a degree of technical and practical expertise that could only come through a lifetime of clinical practice.  Thomas Willis, for example, published  Cerebri Anatome  in 1664, in which he meticulously depicted the structures of the human brain, including delicate vessels and nerves that were often destroyed in the hands less-accomplished anatomists.  And let us not forget William Harvey, whose 1628 work  De Motu Cordis  described the circulation of blood (a discovery influenced heavily by Harvey’s studies at Padua).  Such discoveries were not  typical,  but they speak to the highly specialized knowledge held by 17th-century physicians.  (for more information see: Margaret Pelling, \"Medical Practice in Early Modern England: Trade or Profession?\" in Wilfrid Prest, ed.,  The Professions in Early Modern England , (London: Croom Helm, 1987): 90-128.) Diagnostics, therapeutics, material medica, humoural and chemical theory, regulation of the non-naturals (dietetic and preventative medicine), and bleeding all constituted domains of medical expertise which were learned more from patient interaction than through books. \\n Finally, being of ‘average intelligence’ would have no bearing on your ability to be an early modern physician.  The modern stereotype of physicians as people with above-average intelligence did not exist in the 17th century.  In fact, one of the 18th century critiques of 17th century physicians was their  lack  of intelligence and inquisitiveness. The are a number of stories of comically-inept doctors. With enough money and time anyone could become a physician. \\n I could say more, but I’ve already waxed too long. \\n TL,DR: A formalized modern liberal arts education has little in common with the training/expertise of Roman physicians, though certain rhetorical skills are analogous.  On the other hand, 17th-century medical education is highly analogous to the modern liberal arts, but early modern medical practice itself contained a level of tacit knowledge and clinical expertise that transcended a purely literary education.  In short, given the right resources and station, there is nothing about the OP that would prevent him from  becoming  a physician (though there’d be problems if the OP is, in fact, a she) – but they’d still have to learn a thing or two in order to successfully  practice  medicine. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"Not discouraging anyone from contributing more info on this - particularly with regard to Caesar's motivations - but FYI, there have been a few previous posts asking about portraits on coins.

We know that Jesus said many things. What we don't know is why (save explanations keying off of divinity per se), and Ehrman supplies useful knowledge of the several Judaisms of the time, apocalypticism in particular, the influence of the Romans, the parallels with other geopolitical issues, and all-around useful context regarding Jesus the man. \\n In Lost Christianities, he expands on the several Judaisms to talk about the several Christianities. Of course we don't think of modern Christianity as monolithic, seeing as it split in the Protestant Reformation, but there is an argument to be made that the early Christian church was at least as split, and what we think of as orthodoxy these days was very much up for interpretation. This interpretation depended largely on the historical circumstances of the interpreters. \\n TL;DR: context. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('>Now, Lincoln floated buying the slaves in the border states, starting with Delaware. \\n He did more than just float the idea for Delaware.  On March 6, 1862, [he requested Congress offer compensated gradual emancipation]( for all slave states. \\n >I recommend the adoption of a joint resolution by your honorable bodies, which shall be substantially as follows: \\n >\"Resolved, that the United States ought to cooperate with any state which may adopt gradual abolishment of slavery, giving to such state pecuniary aid, to be used by such state, in its discretion, to compensate for the inconveniences, public and private, produced by such change of system.\" \\n Congress did pass the resolution, but not even the loyalist slave states would agree. But as one commenter noted below, whether slave states would voluntarily agree to emancipation is one issue (they would not), and it is an entirely separate question whether mandatory emancipation plus compensation would have eroded enough support for secession that war could have been avoided. Unfortunately, 1862 was far too late for an \"eminent domain\" alternative.  Both sides had fully committed themselves to war. \\n Thus, the question is whether mandatory compensated emancipation would have avoided war if it had been proposed in January 1861. There\\'s no doubt the South would have hated it, and many individual owners would have resisted it even with compensation.  However, I do think it\\'s a fair question to ask whether that would have been enough to persuade a critical mass of Southerners against secession and  the inevitable war. \\n Irrespective of the likelihood (or unlikelihood) that mandatory compensated emancipation could have stopped the war, I disagree that the cost of compensation was  impossible  to pay for.  According to the Encyclopedia of Black Studies, the Civil War [cost the U.S. government $6 billion dollars]( This was double the estimated $3 billion cost of compensated emancipation. \\n Even [Lincoln acknowledged that it would be cheaper]( to buy all the slaves when he urged Congress to adopt compensated emancipation in 1862: \\n >The point is not that all the states tolerating slavery would very soon, if at all, initiate emancipation but that, while the offer is equally made to all, the more northern shall by such initiation make it certain to the more southern that in no event will the former ever join the latter in their proposed confederacy. I say \"initiation\" because, in my judgment, gradual and not sudden emancipation is better for all.  In the mere financial or pecuniary view, any member of Congress with the census tables and Treasury reports before him can readily see for himself how very soon the current expenditures of this war would purchase, at fair valuation, all the slaves in any named state. \\n So how did the Union pay for the $6 billion cost of the war if (as one panelist on the Daily Show commented) the capital wealth of the Union was only $2.5 billion?  Well, there were at least three things that come to mind. \\n First, the Union implemented the first Federal Income tax. Before it was declared unconstitutional and repealed in 1872, [the income tax provided about a quarter of the Union\\'s war revenue](  Unlike nowadays, the Civil War era income tax was largely voluntary. However, tax returns were not private and the social pressure to support the war effort was still enough to raise substantial revenue. \\n Second, the Union borrowed substantially and raised other taxes. [The amount the Union borrowed during this was well over $2 billion]( \\n >The debt accumulated during the Civil War by the Union was unprecedented. On June 30, 1865, the public debt was $2,677,929,012 (when cash held by the Treasury is subtracted). In 1860, before the start of the Civil War, the public debt had stood at $64,843,831. Now, five years later, the debt was 41 times larger and the share of the public debt per capita had increased from $2.06 in 1860 to $75.01 in 1865. \\n Third, [the Union printed up the money needed:]( \\n >Roughly 15 percent of the war’s financial outlay was covered through the first fiat money issued since the Constitution’s ratification. In early 1862, Congress passed the Legal Tender Act, empowering Secretary Chase to issue a form of paper bills that became popularly known as Greenbacks. The final total of Greenbacks put into circulation reached $431 million, supplemented by a small quantity of interest-bearing notes and other currency. All this government paper coupled with the private bank notes doubled the Union’s money stock by 1863. The consequent inflation put specie at a premium. Greenback dollars had fallen in July of 1864 to a low of 35 cents’ worth of gold. While gold circulated at a premium over Greenbacks in the northeast, Greenbacks were only accepted at a discount from gold on the west coast. \\n TL;DR - Lincoln proposed buying slaves\\' freedom in 1862, but it was too late to avert the war and the slave states would never have done it voluntarily. There is a fair (but speculative) question whether Lincoln could have averted the war if he pursued compensated but mandatory emancipation immediately after taking office. Contrary to the Daily Show\\'s expert, compensated emancipation was less than half the $6 billion financial cost of the Civil War, and could have been financed using the same taxing, borrowing, and money printing powers that financed the Union war effort. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Dante and the church had a rather antagonistic history even well before his writing of the  Commedia , which took place from roughly 1315 until his death in 1321. In 1301, Pope Boniface VIII orchestrated an intervention in Florentine politics that led to the downfall of the White Guelphs, a party of which Dante was a leading member and which had been advocating for decreased papal influence. This led to Dante\\'s permanent exile from Florence and inflamed his enmity against Boniface (and papal authority) even further. In 1302, the Pope issued the bull  Unam sanctam , which essentially argued that all people, but most importantly secular Catholic rulers, were ultimately subject to papal authority. This was predictably explosive: a year later, Boniface died in the captivity of King Philip IV of France. \\n Dante\\'s political treatise  De Monarchia , probably written around 1318 (though this dating is not without controversy), is notable for its strident criticism of  Unam sanctam . It was this treatise, rather than his poetry, that attracted the most significant amount of immediate opprobrium from the church, but the  Commedia  was (to a lesser degree) guilty by association. There are also important elements in the poem that are indicative of Dante\\'s issues with the church and its hierarchy; most obvious is the fact that he represents a number of Popes (including Boniface) as condemned to Hell in the  Inferno . Joan M. Ferrante, in her article \"Hell as the Mirror Image of Paradise,\" writes: \\n >That the church also knew the poem and understood its critical message is clear from various attacks: a Dominican, Guido Vernani, called Dante\\'s poetry \"a poisonous vessel of the father of lies, covered with false and fallacious beauty, by which the author, with poetic phantasms and figments and the eloquence of his words, his siren songs, fraudulently leads not only the sick and ignorant but even the learned to destroy the truth which might save them\" ( De reprobatione Monarchiae ). The reading of Dante\\'s poetry was prohibited at a Dominican chapter in Florence in 1335, although it apparently continued to be popular among the brothers; and various passages from the poem—on ecclesiastical corruption—were condemned by church inquisitions. The whole of the  Monarchia  was on the papal index [of forbidden books] from 1554 to 1881. \\n The  Commedia  was less vilified in ensuing decades than the  Monarchia , though the ecclesiastical reputation of Dante and his works was definitely skating on some thin ice. Vernani doesn\\'t necessarily speak for the whole church, and his tract (as its title indicates) is primarily focused on attacking  De Monarchia  and re-emphasizing the primacy of the church. Teodolinda Barolini notes in her book  Dante and the Origins of Italian Literary Culture  that \"the church on the whole (with a few telling exceptions like the Dominican ban of 1335) was willing to bracket Dante as a poet, a maker of  fictio .\" Anthony K. Cassell, in his book  The Monarchia Controversy: An Historical Study , writes: \\n >Although no official ever made a posthumous indictment of heresy against Dante, the perpetual dread that his departed father could be liable to such an accusation haunted Dante\\'s son Pietro throughout his long and prosperous life. The possibility that his father\\'s  Commedia  could be found heterodox and that he himself could forfeit his patrimony and wealth drove Pietry to compose three versions of his commentary on the  sacro poema  to explain away its controversial verses. \\n In later centuries, as the  Monarchia  receded into obscurity and the  Commedia  enjoyed a resurgence of popularity, the latter would sometimes be condemned by the church primarily due to its depiction of several popes residing in Hell, which (as I understand it) runs counter to Catholic doctrine. \\n TL;DR : In the short term, the church was somewhat offended, but not tremendously or uniformly so. Dante\\'s treatise  De Monarchia  was seen as more dangerous due to its opposition to extreme papal authority, but even that did not earn him the label of heretic. \\n',\n  0),\n ('hi! not discouraging other responses, but you may be interested in these earlier posts \\n \\n [How did popcorn become the staple food of the cinemas (and eventually an accompaniment to the home cinematic experience)?]( \\n \\n tl;dr: [When did the eating in cinema appeared?

The Great Siege of Malta. \\n Odds are you've never heard of that either, but you should wish you did. I'll get to that in a second, but firstly, de la Valette was amazing even before we get to the Ottoman Turks, and it'd be a shame not to be awed a little first. Back in the 16th century when this dude was kicking, Knights actually did the stuff we imagine them to do - swords, armor, beating on sacacens (and being beaten), the whole shebang. The 16th Century was obviously towards the very end of that period, however. The age of the armoured Knights was well and truly winding down due to gunpowder, and changing political systems - but their day wasn't quite dead yet. They just had to find one last niche. \\n Before we go on it should be said that just to get into the Knights of Malta was no joke. They were incredibly parochial – you needed to be a noble, sired by nobles, and pretty committed to the cause. It wasn't always the case – the Hospitallars were founded as an order responsible for a charitable hospital; they tended for pilgrims that were ill, sick, or who had been beaten by bandits while travelling to the Holy Land. They got militant only after the conquest of the Levant, in an attempt to cut out the middle man (if you kill the bandits, pilgrims need the hospital less! The logic is flawless.) In their heyday these guys were the second great military religious order of the age, after the Knights Templar (who, alas, were far wealthier due to their financial savvy.) It all started to unravel, however, after the Suljek Turks (the sacarcens) began the reconquest of the region. First they were forced to abandon Jerusalem and their hospital, then Cyprus (where they had fled) tried to embroil them in politics. The Knights therefore went and took Rhodes, which they rather liked really (good weather, good fortifications), and made themselves pesky by building galleys and raiding Turks. \\n This is where we get back to the heart of our tale. The Knights of St John reinvented themselves as kind of “pirates for Christ”; their galleys pillaged Turkish vessels wherever they could find them. (Normally these galleys – unstable things, but quick - had only two or three Knights on board as officers, with some 'lay brothers' or Sergeants at Arms as backup, and a whole lot of galley slaves). They grew troublesome – never threatening, but definitely troublesome. Think Somalia. Now imagine if Somalia was right of the coast of the USA, like Rhodes is with Turkey. Don't you think the Somali pirates would have incentives to move on pretty quickly from a spot like that? \\n Well, [Suleiman I]( – called the Magnificent for a reason – certainly thought so. He gave St John's boys one choice; GTFO of Rhodes, or be utterly destroyed with the dust scattered to the winds. The Knights chose option A. They found themselves drifting and alone, begging from the Princes of Europe for a home. Eventually, the Spanish King gave them Malta, which was a barren rock of a place ways away from anywhere. The Knights were desperate by this stage though, and took the deal. \\n Where is  de la Valette in all of this? Well, he was a young man to start off with. He served his time as a junior Knight in the galleys, and was a bit of a douchebag. Beat a man half to death. Owned slaves he shouldn't have. The only reason he got to stay was, for all his faults, the man was an outstanding maritime commander – much too good to throw away. He was only better at his job after he got captured by pirates and was forced to be a galley slave for about a year. Yes, you read that right,  he was captured by pirates and enslaved to a galley oar.  After he got out of that, he was tougher than nuclear nails. He was so tough, when it became obvious that the Turks were going to come after Malta, the Knights pretty much ran to elect him as their Master. \\n The reason the Turks were showing up, by the way, varies from author to author. The Great Siege, which in my opinion is the best book on the subject, offers this gem; Bradford suggests the big S was thinking about invading anyway, but the tipping reason was because the Knights had seized a ship with a very important cargo. The Imperial Harem – the languid girls and their guardian Eunuchs – had bought shares in this thing. When the ships captured – and I shit you not – the girls and their eunuchs complained  so much  Suleiman promised them he'd fight just to get them to shut up. \\n de la Valette, when the Turks came, was somewhere between 67 and 72. He was old. He was the same age as your granddad, except this is 1565, so he was about 300 after taking into account inflation and the fact he'd been fighting wars his entire adult life. He had about 6000 soldiers, about 600 of which were Knights. The Turks who landed had about 45,000, about 30,000 of which were as regular as a medieval army got (- this figure includes the Janissaries). The battle that followed was astonishingly epic. \\n The Turkish command was truly inept; it was split into three, with land forces under one guy, sea forces under another guy, and both of them ordered to obey a third guy who wasn't even on the island yet. (The third guy was a Christian corsair, by the way, who was also deeply epic.) The Knights, in the confusion, managed to poison the wells and retreat behind the walls of their three forts before the Turkish force could shake itself out. The poisoned wells caused misery and sickness before they were fixed– but hey, 40k verses 6k right? How hard could this be? \\n Well, they picked on the first Fortress – St Elmo – on the theory that it commanded a good spot to anchor a Turkish fleet, protected the Great Harbour where the Knights had put all  their  fleet, and because the Turks thought it would be easy to take due to its vulnerably to cannon fire. The forces of the Knights thought differently. They put up a truly stupendous fight. With the Knights fully armed and armoured leading them on, they fought from the top of the walls against frontal assaults, plugged the gaps made by the artillery the Turks had brought, and generally gave the world hell. This was helped by reinforcements that were shuttled across the harbour at night They were also helped by the large friendly cavalry force at Massina, who whistled out when the Turks weren't looking and killed all the wounded. They threw back wave after wave, killing on a grand scale, until the third guy finally showed up. Third guy was horrified – he placed guns to cut off the reinforcements and rationalised the attack. Then he promptly died. The Knights were in big trouble anyway. They send a message to de la Valette saying Fort St Elmo was a goner, and they needed an evacuation;  de la Valette told them they had to stay. They protested, so de la Valette scornfully told them to come home “where it is safe” and he would replace them with men “who's courage he knew he could rely on.” The Knights in the fortress promptly told him that they would accept reinforcements only after the fortress was pried from their cold, dead hands. \\n Those Knight and their men made that word good, by the way. Only 9 lived after the Turks finally took the place; the other 1500 were put to the sword. \\n The Turks then took on the main monster – the fort of St Micheal. This was a siege of the old-school; mining attempts, outflanking manoeuvres by sea, siege towers, and straight up charges at the walls with ladders. Let no one tell you that Turks aren't some of the bravest folk on planet earth. The situation inside the walls was so dire, and the fighters were running so low, that 70 odd year old de la Valette personally fought on the walls with a big ole broadsword, basically visually telling the lightly wounded to STFU and get back to work. And the Turks were suffering. The longer the Knights held out, the more illness was taking its toil. The ruthless winter season was nearly upon them, which would have made sailing (and thus evacuation) almost impossible. The Turks feared that Christian Europe was going to send relief – in fact reports that the force had landed was the final straw. So after 10,000 casualties and several months the Turks packed up and went home. \\n ((To add insult to injury, their attempts to get on-board the boats was countermanded at the last second. In the confusion, the relief from Italy actually  did  appear, and the final slaughter was \\nterrible.)) \\n The big S was furious of course, and readied himself to try again – this time with himself in charge. But happily for the Knights he died the year after, meaning no follow up attack was made. \\n TL;DR The Knights of Malta  held off the Turks, and de la Valette became one of the most famous men in Christendom. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('I don\\'t know much about US History, but I\\'ll give a brief overview of Mexico in the 1800\\'s: \\n \\n 1810: The fight for independence begins, spearheaded by creoles and other people lower in the social ladder. \\n 1821: The war is over, and Agustín de Iturbide names himself emperor of Mexico. He only lasts 9 months in power and is forced to leave in exile to Europe. Guadalupe Victoria takes over and establishes a federal republic similar to the one in the USA. \\n 1824: The first official constitution is made. \\n 1829: Spain attempts to reconquer mexico but is defeated by Santa Anna\\'s army (keep an eye on this guy) \\n 1836: A series of seven laws alter the constitution to turn Mexico into a centralist state. This caused Texas to declare its independence and the USA backs texas up. Also, spain recognizes Mexico\\'s independence. \\n 1837: The pastry war. basically, France wanted peconomic privileges in Mexico, and used complaints filed by French citizens in Mexico to justify a war. one specific citizen demanded indemnization for damages done to his pastry store, which Mexico promptly denied. He was requesting such thing on the basis that Santa Anna\\'s officials had eaten in his store and hadn\\'t paid for it. France, along with Great Britain and Spain, set up a military blockade in the gulf of Mexico.  \\n 1845: Texas decides to join the USA, and Mexico is enraged. Military action follows and the USA defends Texas. \\n 1846-1848: The US invades Mexico and takes Mexico City in 1847. The US wins the Mexican-American war. \\n 1848: Mexico signs the Guadalupe-Hidalgo treaty with the US, in which it gives up Arizona, New Mexico, California and Texas. That equals around half its territory.  \\n 1853: Santa Anna sells a part north of Sinaloa in the Gadsden purchase (known as venta de la Mesilla in Mexico). \\n \\n The following years are years of turmoil between liberals and conservatives. Mostly Benito Juárez and Santa Anna\\'s followers. \\n \\n 1857: A new, liberal constitution is made. \\n 1858: Benito Juárez is elected president of Mexico.  \\n 1861: Juárez makes the reform laws, which serve to separate the church from the state. \\n 1862: France invades Mexico but is temporarily repelled in the battle of Puebla, which happened May 5th. \\n 1863: The French return with 30,000 more troops and take the capital. Juárez flees to Chihuahua and establishes his government there. \\n 1863-1867: Emperor Maximilian rules mexico, seeking progress for it and to make it his home, away from France. He is finally captured when France withdraws support and is shot, on Juárez\\'s orders. \\n 1876: Porfirio Díaz \"wins\" the elections and goes on to rule until 1910. During his rule, there was a huge amount of progress, mostly economically. Socially, it was still a mess. Corruption was widespread, harsh laws were in place, unfair taxes were enforced as a result of said corruption, but the country attracted many foreign investors and the country\\'s first railroad was built. \\n 1908: On an interview with the American journalist James Creelman, Días declares that Mexico is finally ready for democratic elections. \\n 1910: Francisco I. Madero runs for president, contending with Díaz. But Díaz later cancels the elections. This caused a lot of controversy and people started a revolution, demanding the right to vote. Díaz agrees on having elections once more, and loses. \\n \\n The whole revolution was a true clusterfuck of peoople siding with one another and then betraying them. It would deserve an even larger explanation. \\n \\n 1817: Venustiano Carranza, president, makes a new constitution. \\n 1820: End of the revolution. Carranza dies. \\n 1826-1829: Cristero war between the government and the Cristeros.

Nearly all of the founders subscribed to an aristocratic, family-line, land-based, export-oriented philosophy of wealth just as the South and Central Americans did.  Their view of how the economy should work could be characterized as Agrarian and semi-Feudal, suspicious of manufacturers and money, just as South/Central American elites believed, and in any case those were not professions for true gentlemen.   Mexico's first constitution was very similar to the US, if memory serves.  Mexico and the South American countries also enjoyed much more labor and capital than the US did in the 18th and early 19th century, had been settled longer, and etc. \\n The difference, according to Johnson, was that the US had in  John Marshall  and thus even though the founders (and the legislators) with only a few exceptions did not much care for the new men of finance and manufacture, those men still could conduct their profession, accumulate and allocate capital, and so on without much disruption imposed from the state. \\n Certainly the runups to wars like  The War of the Pacific , when you read between the lines, seem to be the ultimate outcome of this dynamic of arbitrary takings by the state. \\n I've been looking for a good book on the Mexican first republic and it's fall, but I haven't found one in English thus far.  Anyone have a recommendation? \\n On edit:  So, for example, look at the case of [Fletcher v. Peck]( \\n Tl;dr:  Huge land grants is given to a bunch of guys who are later found to have bribed the legislature of a state.  The people find out, throw the bums out.   New legislature is elected.

Marshall's court says in essence 'too bad, a contract is a contract, even if the people's representatives who made it were corrupt or corrupted'. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"The Roman military system for much of Republic was non-professional and based on required service by all citizens. Each citizen was expected to provide their own equipment and so to serve as a legionnaire or cavalryman etc. you had to have above a certain amount of property and be included in that class in the census. \\n Due to Rome's successful expansion significant land holdings had come under Rome's control and were classed as  ager publicus  -public land - and were usually divided among small holders and given to colonies. With Rome's increasing success the size of the  ager publicus  an increasing amount of this land was instead 'leased' to the wealthy who built up large holdings. (In contravention of a law limiting the size of any one person's possession of the land) \\n At the same time with Rome's regular conflict and with the legions demanding more men for longer many of the small holders that the army relied upon had lost their farms due to their absence, removing them from the manpower pool. \\n To counter this, and the discontent of the growing number of veterans who as a result of service had lost their land, Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus (from a wealthy, consular, plebian family) once elected as Tribune of Plebs (in 133BC) used the powers of that position to attempt to pass a law primarily to enforce the earlier restrictions on holding size and to redistribute any land confiscated among the landless. \\n While the law itself might have been somewhat controversial, Ti. Gracchus' approach was much more so. The Tribunes of Plebs as a result of its origins had several important powers. They could bring laws to the  concilium plebis  -plebeian assembly- which had the suthority to pass laws, without first consulting the senate. They could also veto any proposal before the assembly or act of a magistrate. Gracchus used the first to bring a law before the people, then when opposed by another tribune's veto he called for his removal from the post (possibly violating his sacrosanctity in the process). Having passed his law he then later used his power to allocate the gift of the king of Pergamum to Rome to funding the law, again breaking the traditional powers of the senate. \\n Nothing he did was strictly against law (except if he did indeed lay hands on Octavius the other tribune), and this angered many senatorial Romans. In order to avoid being prosecuted when his year ended he secured re-election and promised more reforms. When he armed a group of supporters in response to a possible threat from the senate a crowd was roused by the pontifex maximus and he and many supporters were killed. \\n His brother Gaius attempted still more reforms, reforming the judicial system to include equites as well as senators in juries, and outlawing capital courts except the assembly. He also passed a law making the state cover the cost of equipment for soldiers and raising the conscription age to 17. He also expanded his brothers land reforms including the creation of new settlements in Italy and overseas. He instituted the Lex Frumentaria which required the state to provide corn to the people at reduced cost by buying grain and importing it. \\n Most significantly (and relevant to the original question again!), he proposed the enfranchisement of the Latins and allies, a measure that failed as it went against his core support (poor Roman citizens). \\n After escalating violence, including the murder of a priest by Gracchan supporters a  senatus consultum ultimum  which granted emegency powers to the consul to resist tyranny and defend the state. A large force of senators, equestrians and others was armed and after a confrontation near the Forum with the Gracchans broken Gaius fled, and then committed suicide. \\n Many of the reforms were then repealed shortly afterwards and manpower continued to be a problem for the army until ultimately solved by professionalisation. \\n A good overview of these events, and indeed those up to the end of the Julio-Claudians, can be found in H.H. Scullard's  From the Gracchi to Nero  although it can be a tad dry. \\n TL,DR . The two Gracchi brothers attempted to divide up public land among the landless to solve a manpower crisis. Tiberius was killed because his methods angered the senate. Gaius because his expanded program and several deaths of importatant men made him a threat. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('Then in 1966 there was a  massive  wave of reports that dwarfed all prior reports to date. This lead to serious calls for Congressional hearings by Gerald Ford. There were two major Congressional hearings in the late 60s, and both were downright  nightmares  for Project Blue Book. \\n Also in 1966, Blue Book convened a 1-day ad hoc scientific review panel now called the O\\'brien Panel (a young Carl Sagan sat on this panel, doubtless fulfilling or at least whetting his wild childhood aspirations to know what was  really happening  with UFOs). Among other things, this panel recommended the USAF find a university to run a scientific review of the reports and issue recommendations. [[11]]( \\n After being rejected by many universities, eventually the University of Colorado took on the project. It was headed by the very well regarded scientist EU Condon (an ex-Manhattan Project nuclear physicist who made a name for himself to the public by fighting back when McCarthy accused him of Un-American activities). What followed is, in my opinion, a flamboyant and farcical caricature of the scientific process. \\n In short, the Colorado Project issued a  massive  report [[12]]( Condon\\'s famous conclusions and recommendations says: \\n >  As indicated by its title, the emphasis of this study has been on attempting to learn from UFO reports anything that could be considered as adding to scientific knowledge. Our general conclusion is that nothing has come from the study of UFOs in the past 21 years that has added to scientific knowledge. Careful consideration of the record as it is available to us leads us to conclude that further extensive study of UFOs probably cannot be justified in the expectation that science will be advanced thereby. \\n Scandalously, Condon, who wrote this conclusion, did essentially  none  of the casework for the project. And in reality, something like 20-30% of the cases actually documented in the report are classified as unknowns! Multiple project members quit or were fired during the project due to internal politics and a general feeling that the project had a per-determiend negative conclusion and was not scientific. Psychologist David Saunders was fired for \"incompetence\" from the project, and his book criticizing the project came out before the actual report. [[13]]( \\n Having read the entire Condon Report myself, I agree with the UFO community\\'s allegation that it clearly intended to provide justification for ending the USAF investigation, and not at all a serious scientific document. \\n Sadly, it has remained \"definitive\". Anyone wishing to dismiss UFO reports can simply cite Condon, a famous and accomplished physicist, and his conclusions. The odds of anyone then following up and  reading  the Condon Report are vanishingly low. Did I mention that the Colorado UFO project was funded by the USAF? \\n The Colorado Project and the closing of Blue Book were major discussion points during the AAAS symposium on UFOs co-organized by Carl Sagan in late December of 1969.  UFOs: A Scientific Debate  (1972) details the papers presented at that symposium, and importantly a letter from the panelists to the Secretary of the Air Force stopped the Project Blue Book files from being destroyed. \\n TL,DR \\n The USAF  had  to investigate UFOs because of the intense publicity they received. They had to close their investigation for exactly the same reason. \\n',\n  0),\n ('> Why would anybody take UFO reports seriously? I don\\'t mean to be flippant. It\\'s an honest question. If a lower-class man in northern Pakistan says that aliens were flying over his house, we\\'d all know it was likely a US drone. So why does anyone take the people in Nevada or Belgium more seriously? I\\'m interested in the sociological phenomenon that leads us to not marginalizing these people. \\n Some people take UFO reports seriously because many of the reports come from very good sources. It is a cultural distortion that says UFO reports come primarily from \"poor sources\". In reality, the opposite is true: there is a long-attested correlation between the quality of the observer and the likelihood that the UFO report remains unidentified  after  analysis. (See [Project Blue Book\\'s Special Report 14, p24]( \\n And of course no serious researcher would base their analysis solely on eyewitness reports. But when the eyewitness testimony seems good  and  there is corroborating physical data that can be studied using the scientific method, then you start getting to the serious reports that warrant more attention. \\n As I\\'ve said elsewhere, my personal favorite report is the 1957 RB-47 UFO report. At the time, the RB-47 was the United States\\' most advanced spy plane. Before the U-2 was developed, sorties of RB-47s would penetrate Soviet airspace and use their massive array of sensors to collect information on Soviet anti-aircraft responses, take photographs, and analyze Soviet radar. (See  Body of Lies  by James Bamford for a non-UFO-related discussion of the RB-47\\'s role in top level NSA espionage). \\n The UFO event is described in great detail by Dr. James McDonald in his 1969 lecture  \"Science in Default\"  with the  appearance  of scientific study (Condon). Though of course I acknowledge that McDonald was intensely politicized by his work with UFOs. Incidentally, one of the reasons McDonald was so politicized is that he  accidentally  saw an un-redacted copy of the classic [1952 Durant Report of the Robertson UFO Panel]( In previously released copies, the \"education and debunking\" section was redacted or not included. You can imagine how a scientist who was struggling to get other scientists to take UFO report seriously might react to finding out the CIA has been trying to debunk scientific interest in UFOs for at least a decade. \\n TL,DR \\n Some people get into UFOs because there is solid yet unexplained data. Others are stimulated by the history of official \"forgetting\" -- regardless of what the \"UFOs\" really are, there is solid evidence of a \"UFO coverup\". And of course some people are witnesses themselves and are looking for an explanation. \\n > As a second question, to what degree are UFO reports correlated with access to media? Sure, Nevada gets a lot of reports as do places in Russia with nearby military bases. But what about the empty places in Africa? South America? Central Asia? \\n Other people have asked this, and I really cannot answer this question rigorously. The sad fact is that UFO studies are in such a state of disarray that there are no good centralized databases to refer to. Lacking a (relatively) comprehensive database of  all  reports, how can anyone seriously discussion correlations like this? I can say that my understanding is that UFO reports come from literally every country on the planet, and are in no way solely associated with urban populations or the presence of mass media. \\n As a starting point, I will again recommend my favorite historical reference on the subject: \\n [\"Unidentified Flying Objects in Classical Antiquity\"]( published in [The Classical Journal]( in 2007 by NASA astrophysicist [Richard Stothers]( [[PDF]]( \\n I offered some references [here]( if you are interested in pursing the subject yourself. \\n',\n  0),\n ('> Can you give a general summary of what you perceive to be the view of the military/government/aviation community of what they believe is going on? \\n This is another huge question. It depends on who you\\'re talking about (the military, government and aviation communities are very different). It also depends on what time frame. So this is my own personal impression based on what I\\'ve read and not intended to be \"objective\". \\n To speak in broad terms, in the military and aviation communities, UFO reports are considered more serious than to the general public. When a pilot who is well-regarded by their peers reports seeing something unexplainable, other pilots tend to take that report more seriously. Donald Keyhoe used to like to make the point that if these pilots are so crazy and delusional because they see UFOs, why are they still flying? Why are they still allowed to take other human lives in their hands based on their ability to read their instruments? \\n At the same time, reporting a UFO is not \"career enhancing\". There\\'s a myth that people report UFOs in order to make personal profit. While this may be true for a very small subset of \"contactees\" or people who sell books based on their experiences, in reality most Americans who report UFOs are greeted with either indifference or overt hostility. In my mind, this adds a dimension of seriousness to reports made by professionals, scientists, or pilots: why would they risk the ridicule of their peers if they didn\\'t firmly believe they saw what they saw? \\n Getting to the government, it depends on the branch. In the executive branch, my understanding is that FDR basically didn\\'t care about the Foo Fighter reports of WWII. Truman received quarterly oral briefings about the status of UFO investigations. He had to deal with the 1952 DC reports, so there was considerable public pressure on him to comment on what was going on.  Here\\'s a political cartoon of Truman and flying saucers from 1952 . I can\\'t vouch for the provenance of these documents, but here  this Nov 12, 1963 document . Who knows what was up with George Bush Sr. Bill Clinton had multiple members of his staff who were very interested in UFOs, and he also was President during the 50th anniversary of Roswell. Then there was the lawsuit of Area 51 employees against the government, asking to find out about some chemicals they alleged they were exposed to. But now we\\'re brushing up against that 20-year limit of events being history. \\n I cannot hope to accurately summarize the attitudes of the various intelligence agencies. But in broad strokes, the Army Air Force took point starting in the summer of 1947. The FBI was very interested, but Hoover was concerned that he would be shut out of the investigation. The CIA Became seriously involved no later than early 1953. The Office of Naval Intelligence has a long history of involvement with the reports, but has received little to no public attention (there are far less citizens watching the oceans than watching the skies). The NSA documents that have been declassified are so redacted it\\'s a joke. I will note that my favorite case, the 1957 RB-47 UFO, would in my mind  certainly  have been documented by NSA at the time: they were in charge of the RB-47 reconnaissance flights over the USSR. In my mind, the odds of the NSA ever declassifying anything they deem to be important are essentially zero. \\n TL,DR \\n There are lots of complicated attitudes, and these attitudes are rarely monolithic. But there is a common thread of publicly ridiculing the subject while secrelty spending time, money and energy trying to study the UFO reports. \\n',\n  0),\n ('This is an interesting question, and I do not have access to the necessary data to offer a definitive answer to it. To do my best, I would start by pointing out two things: \\n (1) UFO reports are a global phenomenon. That is, the reports come from all over the world. As Jacques Vallee said in the 70s, he is not aware of any countries that  did not  have any UFO reports. \\n (2) The concentration and distribution of reports has been known for decades to vary. That is, during a \"wave\" or \"flap\" of reports, the reports tend to cluster in specific regions. So question of which areas/countries are most \"visited\" in my mind depends very strongly on the time frame you are considering. Perhaps someone somewhere has done a meta-analysis of as many databases as possible, but I\\'ve never seen such a thing. As Carl Sagan estimated in the 80s that there had been  millions  of UFO reports documented. (I believe the citation is from  The Varieties of Scientific Experience , but I don\\'t have a copy of the book handy). \\n My area of interest is in Cold War era reports, primarily in America. In America, one pattern is that good UFO reports tend to cluster around military and nuclear facilities. Without getting too speculative, I would offer that such facilities tend to have highly trained and vigilant observers. So even if we assume a totally random distribution of \"events\", such places are likely to generate documented reports. \\n One great book on the subject is  The Report on the UFO Wave of 1947 . It contains day-by-day maps of the documented reports [[1]]( [Here]( is a map of the peak of that early wave of reports on July 9-10. \\n The USAF Project Blue Book\\'s Special Report 14 also has many maps showing the distribution of reports over time and space in America [[2]]( \\n TL,DR \\n I don\\'t know. If I had to guess where the most reports were made in America, I\\'d say Nevada, California, or New York. \\n \\n [1] \\n [2] \\n',\n  0),\n ('Monolatry means worshiping only one god, but knowing other gods exist. In other words, you make that god your Lord. \\n Now, we have to be careful about interpreting Biblical passages, because we could mistake certain forms of rhetoric. \\n In \"The Origins of Biblical Monotheism\", p. 151 and 152, Mark S. Smith tells us: \\n > To begin, we need to define the terms of discussion. Most interpreters include two kinds of expressions in clearly monistic claims.

Monotheistic exclusivity is not simply a matter of cultic observance, as in the First Commandment\\'s prohibition against \"no other gods before me\" in Exodus 20:3 and Deut. 5:7. It extends further to an understanding of deities in the cosmos (no other gods, period). The second involves statements claiming that all other deities are \"not\" (\\'ên), \"nothings\" (\\'elîlîm), or \"dead\" (metîm). \\n > The first category includes the following passages as examples of monotheism, with the expression \"alone\" (*lebadd-): \\n Deut 4:35, 2Kings 19:15, Nehemiah 9:6, Psalm 86:10 [quotations skipped by me for space purposes] \\n > All but the first of these statements belong to prayers. Monotheism here belongs to the rhetoric of praise. Deuteronomy 4:35 is part of a speech of Moses to the Israelites. Accordingly, it is a \"sermon\" or the like, which belongs to the rhetoric of persuation. A similar rhetorical approachobtains in the monotheistic formulation with *zulat-: \\n > 2 Samuel 7:22 = 1 Chronicles 17:20: \"there is no god except You according to all that we have heard with our ears.\" \\n > In this instance we again see the rhetoric of praise. One must be careful, for terms of exclusivity need not always represent the existence of only one [e.g. *zûl- in 1Samuel 21:10]). However, I accept the generally accepted view that these terms of divine exclusion represent monotheism. \\n > The second category essentially denies the reality of other deities. One way to express monotheistic exclusivity in this manner involves the sentence predicate, \\'ên, \"(there is) not\": \\n (Quotes include Deut 4:39, 1Samuel 2:2, Jeremiah 16:19-20) \\n > The first case (Deut 4:39) is part of a larger speech including the monotheistic claim of Deut 4:35. For the criterion of other gods regarded as \"nothings\", or \"dead\", the following passages conform: \\n > Psalm 96:5 = 1 Chronicles 16:26: \"For all the gods of the nations are nothings\" (\\'elîlîm). \\n > Psalm 82:7: \"Therefore like a mortal you shall die (*mwt), like one of the princes you shall fall.\" \\n > The first passage (Psalm 96:5) shows a clever pun made between the other elohim (gods) and elilim (nothings). Again, the effect is rhetorical, designed as much to persuade and reinforce as it is to assert. The language of divine death, as we saw in chapter 6, belongs to a slightly different rhetoric. It depicts the old order of Israelite polytheism passing to the new order of monotheism. \\n > With other statements, it is important to be careful. Some scholars would accept as monotheistic passages that condemn the veneration of other deities, without commenting on their existence. One might then include the First Commandment (Exodus 20:3 and Deuteronomy 5:7) or Deuteronomy 32:12, 15b-21, and 39-39. Or one might be tempted to add the Shema of Deuteronomy 6:4 to the list of monotheistic claims. \\n So, basically, Smith tells us that the monotheistic passages in Deuteronomy belonged to a rhetoric of persuation to demand obedience. Later he mentions that assertive monotheistic statements like the ones in Isaiah 44:6-21 belong to the Exilic period or later. \\n TL;DR: The statements in the Torah about monotheism belong to a persuasive rhetoric, they were written to motivate rather than teach. Assertive monotheistic statements (written to teach rather than persuade) belong only during or after the Exile. (And IMHO, if the statements in Deuteronomy were assertively monotheistic, the Israelites didn\\'t really buy it; this is why Isaiah 44 had to be written during the Exile) \\n Edit: Rephrased a couple of statements. \\n',\n  0),\n ('>I am curious about regionalism in Judaism. How was, say, Iraqi Judaism different from contemporary German Judaism? \\n First of all, to simplify things I\\'ll use Jewish internal terms for Jewish groups when possible.  These include Ashkenazim for Europe (originally just the Rhine Valley, but since the middle ages usually Europe as a whole), Yekkes for German Jews, Litvaks for Lithuanian Jews, and Galatzianers for Jews from Galacia. \\n So the big difference is usually culture.  No matter where, Jewish culture tends to absorb elements from whoever is around.  To use your specific example, Yekkish culture has a lot of influence from German culture, especially post-emancipation when Jews weren\\'t segregated.  The same is true of Iraq.  That\\'s the real barrier between Jews of different origins, and has been problematic in Israel. \\n But I think you\\'re asking about the religion, not the people in general.  Generally, there are two main subdivisions--Ashkenazi and Sefardi.  First I\\'ll discuss sefardi, then Ashkenazi.  The term \"sefardi\" is a bit of a misnomer.  It means \"Spanish\", but the vast majority of Sefardi Jews never had ancestors in Spain.  What happened is that when persecution drove the Jews from Spain, quite a few ended up in North Africa and the Middle East.  Because Spain was the dominant Jewish center at the time, with the best-regarded Rabbis and a large community, areas with significant Sefadi immigration effectively adopted Sefardi theology.  Because of this strange terminology, they\\'re often called  Edot HaMizrach , meaning \"communities of the East\", and the individuals  mizrachim , Easterners.  It\\'s still a strange term, because it sometimes applies to people in North Africa, who are actually West of most major Jewish communities historically. \\n Ashkenazi Jews began in the Rhine valley.  Persecution during the first crusade drove them east.  They\\'re split into Yekkes in Germany (mostly the Rhine Valley, historically), Litvaks, and Galetzianers, plus groups in Southern Europe.  The big divide is Western/Eastern, for reasons I\\'ll explore below. \\n Note that there are groups who don\\'t fit neatly into either.  Yemeni Jews never really assimilated into Spanish Judaism very well, though they\\'re usually considered under the Sefardi umbrella.  Italy preserves some really interesting unique ritual stuff that doesn\\'t quite fit either group.  Generally, groups who aren\\'t clearly Ashkenazi get lumped in with the Sefardim. \\n Each of the Ashkenazi regions has a distinct theological development that never happened elsewhere.  In Germany, for Reform and Conservative movement developed (though the latter only was distinct in the US).  These essentially pioneered new leniency in Jewish law (in the case of Conservative), or the idea that Jewish law wasn\\'t obligatory (Reform), along with a whole host of other concepts.  Reform explored Jewish religion vs. Jewish nationhood, often rejecting one in favor of the other (which one it was changed a lot).  In Orthodoxy, new views on how to deal with the outside world (which wasn\\'t much of an issue before) developed, leading to Modern Orthodoxy being a \"thing\".  This was the general trend in Western Europe after emancipation and the enlightenment. \\n In Eastern Europe, the trend was Chassidism.  Essentially, it was a religious movement based heavily on Kabbalah.  It was harshly opposed by many at first, and was strongest in Southeastern Europe.  While Sefardi Jews have Kabbalah too, it made a whole new sect (or set of sects) in Eastern Europe.  They tend to be based around a \"Rebbe\" who leads the sect, rather than the observant populace listening to Rabbis who listen to the prominent Rabbis of the era. \\n Each of those things just didn\\'t happen in the Middle East.  The presence of sects and denominations just isn\\'t around so much in Jews from Sefardi backgrounds, and wasn\\'t at all until the groups mixed.  For this reason, the non-Orthodox denominations are fairly small in Israel, but being non-observant (or \"traditional\") and attending an Orthodox synagogue are fairly common. \\n But the other differences are liturgical and ritual.  While each group in Europe has minor differences (Poland vs. Lithuania vs. Germany), the big difference is Chassidic vs. non-Chassidic.  Nowadays, the liturgies are pretty standardized into those two.  The Sefardim have variation between places, too (North Africa vs. Iraq vs. Syria, etc), but those are the broad families.  Various rituals change along those borders, too.  Whether or not corn and legumes are permissible on Passover and certain more obscure ritual questions are Ashkenazi/Sefardi debates, and each major group uses a different basic setup for chanting Torah, with sub-groupings in each.  For this reason, there are 2 chief Rabbis of Israel, one for each group. \\n Generally, the difference comes from which classical Rabbis are the main sources of law.  Ashkenazi halakhah is based mostly on the Rama (the European gloss to the Shulchan Arukh) and other European texts, while Sefardi halakhah is based on the Shulchan Arukh of Rabbi Karo and Maimonides (especially among Yemenites, where he\\'s the main authority).  The general trend I\\'ve noticed is that Ashkenazi Judaism tends to add more customary strictures, but does a better job defining them.  For instance, the time to wait between meat and dairy is much longer in Europe, but Ashkenazi Judaism developed a system in which foods were \"neutral\", or \"parve\".  There\\'s a reason the words for meat and dairy in kashrut are Hebrew, but \"parve\" is Yiddish.  I\\'m not sure how widely that holds, though.  The difference in certain practices and which prior Rabbis are the primary sources is the big easy difference. \\n tl;dr there\\'s variation in broad categories, Ashkenazi and Sefardi.  Within each, there are sub-groupings.  Ashkenaz has some new theological movements, but outside them they share largely the same theology.  There are some practices that break down among those groups, too. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Marxist historiography proposes a fairly rigid, progressivist model for the stages of economic development--primitive to slave to feudal to capitalist to communist. There are a myriad of problems with this model and the specific outline has largely been discarded for most of economic history even if certain principles (eg looking at social structure through access to means of production) have been retained to great effect. The exception is the study of the classical, and especially Roman, economy which has until quite recently remained in thrall to ideas of a \"slave economy\" primarily due to a series of Marxist historians such as Michael Rostovtzeff and, more recently and influentially, Moses Finley. The key to this is a model in which the Romans did not make rational, profit oriented economic decisions, but instead based their decisions on norms of social acceptability, ie, unprofitable landed agricultural ventures. The evidence for this comes almost entirely from literary sources, particularly Cicero\\'s  de officia . \\n Now, you may be able to see the flaw in this reasoning, namely that it rests on an uncritical interpretation of didactic texts, and more damningly, extrapolates the attitudes of a massive empire of perhaps sixty million from the writings of a tiny elite of only a few hundred, and justified by an entirely uncritical application of a Marxist historian named Gramsci\\'s view of \"cultural homogeneity\". The problem with this application, aside from a complete disregard of the extremely problematic nature of source survival, is that it assumes the literary culture of the classical world is directly comparable to that if early twentieth century Europe (Marxists in general have a Eurocentrism problem). I mean, I think the theory in general is complete self-serving bullshit, but even if it weren\\'t this application is extremely cack-handed. \\n So what Marxists did is place a mountain of social theory upon a tiny, leaky raft of evidence, but did it so skillfully that it dominated discourse until the past decade and a half or so. Recently the archaeological evidence has become simply too powerful to maintain the Marxist model, and a more critical use of literary evidence (such as favoring Cicero\\'s  letters  over his moral writings) has washed away the last vestiges of it. But this hasn\\'t really gotten outside of the narrow field of classical economics, and so practically every other field (particularly literary ones) maintain the old model. \\n TL,DR: the evidence points to a complex, quasi-capitalist Roman economy, the musings of a few white guys in the nineteenth century point towards a primitavist, \"slave\" economy. For decades scholars gave more credence to the latter. \\n',\n  0),\n ('>History is taught ad studied as a science, (ideally) free from political or religious influence \\n Ideally  being the operative word. \\n I just mean the theory behind history follows the scientific method and incorporates hard scientific facts  as much as possible . Mostly.

He compresses time (Hal & Hotspur\\'s ages in Henry IV part 1), sanitizes details (the sanity of Charles VI in Henry V), fabricates events (the Dauphin\\'s tennis balls in Henry V), deploys deliberate ambiguity (the character of Cleopatra), commits character assassination (Joan d\\'Arc in Henry VI part 1), reinforces Tudor propaganda (you name it), flatters the powers-that-be (Banquo in MacBeth), and omits inconvenient historical details (Anne Boleyn anyone?).  But that isn\\'t news.  Anyone who has studied The Histories that concern English history is aware that Shakespeare never let something like facts get in the way of a good story. \\n Shakespeare was walking on thin ice when he wrote his plays about English history and his caution is pretty easy to spot sometimes.  He knew better than to bite the hands that fed him, so the direct ancestors of Elizabeth I, James I, and various other noble patrons are almost always portrayed in a positive light.  One of the important themes present in all these plays is that rebellion is a bad thing that always leads to disastrous consequences eventually.  This is driven home with great emphasis by the Bishop of Carlyle\\'s fantastic speech defending the King in Richard II Act 4, Scene 1, which ends as follows (Lines 146 - 150): \\n >O, if you rear this house against this house, \\n >It will the woefullest division prove \\n >That ever fell upon this cursed earth. \\n >Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so, \\n >Lest child, child\\'s children, cry against you, \"Woe!\" \\n These sorts of quotes are used frequently to make the case that The Bard was essentially a conservative playwright interested in reinforcing the status quo.  But there was more to him than that.  When Shakespeare needed to portray things like political unrest, rebellion, and regicide positively he found his outlets in ancient history. \\n I will pause here to beg the reader\\'s patience because I am about to march towards a potential minefield of literary, historical, and theatrical controversy.  There are multiple candidates for the answer to this question.  Criticism, additional details, and differing opinions are always welcome. \\n It is my personal opinion that the answer to your question is  Julius Caesar.   At least in the sense that Shakespeare attempted to be (more or less) faithful to Plutarch\\'s accounts of history.   Plutarch’s  Lives of Julius Caesar and Marcus Brutus  was translated in 1597 by Thomas North, was tremendously popular, and Shakespeare almost certainly had access to it.   This is not to say that the play does not take liberties  as I will discuss later. \\n Shakespeare, in many cases, changes the narration but retains the essence of the story: \\n >There Brutus, being afraid to be besieged, sent back again the noblemen that came thither with him, thinking it no reason that they, which were no partakers of the murder, should be partakers of the danger. \\n (Plutarch 126) \\n > Cassius:  And leave us Publius; lest that the people, \\n >Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief. \\n > Brutus:  Do so; and let no man abide this deed \\n >But we the doers. \\n (Caesar 3.1.89-92) \\n Here we hear a difference in language, but see a continuity in story.  Another example would be the battle scene where Brutus contemplates suicide: \\n >Brutus as he sat bowed towards Clitus one of his men and told him somewhat in his ear; the other answered him not, but fell a-weeping. Thereupon he proved Dardanus, and said somewhat also to him. At length he came to Volumnius himself, and , speaking to him in Greek, prayed him…that he would help him to put his hand to his sword, to thrust it in him to kill him. \\n (Plutarch 170) \\n > Brutus:  Sit thee down, Clitus; slaying is the word, \\n >It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus. \\n > Clitus:  What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world. \\n > Brutus:  Peace then, no words. \\n > Clitus:  I’ll rather kill myself. \\n > Whispering \\n > Brutus:  Hark thee, Dardanius. \\n > Dardanius:  Shall I do such a deed? \\n (Caesar 5.5.4-8) \\n When Caesar is speaking to his wife about the nature of the omens she has observed, Shakespeare transmutes Plutarch’s narration into Caesar’s words: \\n >And when some of his friends did counsel him to have a guard for the safety of his person, and some also did offer themselves to serve him, he would never consent to it, but said, it was better to die once than always to be afraid of death. \\n (Plutarch 78) \\n > Caesar:  Cowards die many times before their deaths; \\n >The valiant never taste of death but once, \\n >Of all the wonders that I yet have heard, \\n >It seems to me most strange that men should fear; \\n >Seeing that death, a necessary end, \\n >Will come when it will come. \\n (Caesar 2.2.32-37) \\n There are, of course, exceptions but almost the entire plot is lifted directly from Plutarch\\'s writings into Shakespeare\\'s play.  Sometimes he takes the words straight out of Plutarch\\'s mouth in a way that we today might consider plagiarism such as in the fifth act when Brutus\\' army is preparing to do battle: \\n >…the greatest and chiefest things among men are most uncertain, and that, if the battle fall out otherwise today then we wish or look for, we shall hardly meet again, what are thou then determined to do… \\n (Plutarch 154) \\n > Cassius:  Now, most noble Brutus, \\n >The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may, \\n >Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age! \\n >But since the affairs of men rest still incertain \\n >Let’s reason with the worst that may befall. \\n >If we do lose this battle, then is this \\n >The very last time we shall speak together: \\n >What are you then determined to do? \\n (5.1.93-100) \\n Another example: \\n >…he should wear his diadem in all other places both by sea and land… \\n (Plutarch 90) \\n > Casca:  And he shall wear his crown by sea and land \\n (1.3.87) \\n There is also the matter of Plutarch\\'s omens: \\n >For, touching the fires in the element and…also the solitary birds to be seen at noondays sitting in the great market-place…men were seen going up and down in fire; and, furthermore, that there was a slave of the soldiers that did cast a marvelous burning flame out of his hand, insomuch as they that saw it thought he had been burnt, but, when the fire was out, it was found he had no hurt. Caesar self also, doing sacrifice unto the gods, found that one of the beasts which was sacrificed had no heart; and that was a strange thing in nature – how a beast could live without a heart. \\n (Plutarch 86,87) \\n > Casca:  But never till to-night, never till now, \\n >Did I go through a tempest dropping fire… \\n >And yesterday the bird of night did sit \\n >even at noon-day upon the market-place, \\n >Hooting and shrieking. \\n (1.3.9-13) \\n >…a hundred ghastly women, \\n >Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw \\n >Men all in fire walk up and down the streets. \\n (1.3.23-25) \\n >A common slave – you know him well by sight – \\n >Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn \\n >Like twenty torches join’d, and yet his hand, \\n >Not sensible of fire, remaine’d unscorch’d. \\n (1.3.15-18) \\n > Servant:  They would not have you to stir forth today. \\n >Plucking the entrails of an offering forth, \\n >They could not find a heart within the beast. \\n (2.2.38-40) \\n I\\'m not going to type out  all  of these, but you get the idea: Shakespeare\\'s plot and text rely heavily on his source material. \\nThe two are not without their differences.  Shakespeare compresses the events of several years into 5 days.  The period between Caesar\\'s victory and Antony/Octavius regaining control is a span of 3 years.  Caesar\\'s assassination and the dueling speeches of Antony and Brutus happened months apart according to Plutarch while Shakespeare places all three events on one gigantically important day: The Ides of March.  Shakespeare\\'s final battle happens on the fifth day of the play, where Plutarch sets it months after the assassination. \\n All this compression was done in order to keep the story clipping along, which Shakespeare does with uncanny skill.  Unlike Shakespeare, Plutarch is not known as a master of suspense.  Shakespeare\\'s real gift to the story is giving living, breathing, 3-dementional personalities to Cassius and Brutus that are not present in Plutarch.  The Bard gives lip service to the sanctity of the crown in the character of Caesar, but in the end it is Brutus that best fits the description of the Shakespearean hero. \\n While this may be an imperfect answer to your question in that cases can be made for other histories, it is an answer nonetheless. \\n TL;DR: Julius Caesar \\n Sources: \\n Arden Shakespeare version of  Julius Caesar \\n Lives of Julius Caesar and Marcus Brutus  by Plutarch (Thomas North translation) \\n The Concise Oxford Companion to the Theatre  by Phyllis Hartnoll \\n EDIT: Formatting, spelling, and grammar. \\n',\n  0),\n ('USA info only, sorry \\n I think you also need to be way more specific.

The Roman Legion had an active pipeline of men. Legionaries weren't replaced until the Legion made it back to the outermost towns, where the new recruits would be billeted and waiting. They would then be trained by the Legion and incorporated into whichever  Contubernium  needed them. \\n Auxiliaries on the other hand, were replaced constantly. It is estimated that only about [half]( of the recruits enlisted survived to their retirement, after [25]( years in the Legions. The Retirement package was great however. Citizenship and a lump sum, as well as a pension. \\n Sorry, that was a bit of a tangent. Anyways, Auxiliaries were replaced as soon as possible, and any native non-Roman could sign up to be an Auxiliary. There was no such thing as background checks at the time, so a few questions might be asked around their village. Or if the recruit came from a particularly troublesome area, they might be turned down out of hand.

Also, both of you suppose that there is historical accuracy or even a deeper meaning of history. The whole concept of \"reporting the world as it is, or was.\" CanadianHistorian mentioned, probably channeling Rankes spirit, seems somewhat outdated to me. With constructivism, the post-colonial and the linguistic turn in mind, the concept seems hard to defend. I would state that historians (similar to all other scientists) can only view the past by the means of perception they have. These means of perception are molded by the time we are living in, thus the questions we ask of our sources, the way we think about them and the conclusions we draw. We can, of course should, try to do justice to our sources and not judge them by the standards of our time. But the basic fact remains, that with all the magnificient skill some historians posess to get \"into\" a time and see their sources in the light, they might have been seen in by contemporaries, we are still tied down in our time. We have to present our findings in the language and modes available in our time. (I recommend reading Hayden White,  The Content of the Form  and the discussions it has sparked over the last 50 or so years) \\n And we should not forget the fact that we are human. All thoughts of historical perspective aside, when i read about acts of violence that were commonplace in the past, my modern self is morally appalled by them. I can try to think objectively about them and present my work as neutrally as possible, but i can not guarantee i will succeed in that. Moreover my readers will also react in a certain way to my statements and apply their moral beliefs and convictions to them. \\n So, back to topic, the whole issue does not boil down to historical accuracy versus the obligation of intellectuals in my opinion. It boils down to applying our established and accepted methodology that is designed to ensure a measure of comparability and rein in idle speculation versus using the clout and respect being a historian entails for political ends, by falsely claiming to have used our methodology properly. \\n That is a fine line to walk. As historians we employ many different methods of explanation and evaluation of sources. Our works contain arguments based on different disciplines and on common assumptions about human nature. Moreover, in telling history we also tell stories. We employ literary means to convey our findings. Our stories have protagonists and antagonists, peripeteia and climax. We can not expect to tell these stories without some judgement \"leaking\" in. And it would be tragic if it did not. Were it possible to tell our stories without values, without story, they would be without narrative and ultimately without any meaning. Fortunately it is impossible. \\n What did i want to say with all this rambling? It is fine to use values and even to judge historical events, as we perceive them, as a historian. But you have to be conscious about the fact that you are giving a subjective opinion (in the best cases, a subjective opinion shared by a majority of your peers, but still subjective). And you ahve to submit to the scholarly process of review, which should point out the instances, where you overshot the mark and went outside the boundaries of what we consider reasonable objectivity. \\n And in comes the crux of the media intellectual. If i present my findings to a group of scholars i can reasonably expect them to be aware of the previous observations. In a public setting, my findings will most likely be misunderstood or misconstrued, tailored to fit into a belief system i do not share or simpyl dumbed down to the point of losing their original meaning. Sadly this is a fact every intellectual should be aware of, and as a result we should be careful what we say in a public forum. Bemoaning the state of public discourse does not seem like an avenue to change public discourse, only the establishment of new practices in discourse has any chance of doing that. (pandering: thanks AskHistorians for doing that in its corner of the internet) \\n Briefly discussing the example in the OP: I can not judge Zinns study, since i have not read it, but the cited comment overshoots the mark. His intentions and his judgements of current policy are not pertinent to an academic discussion of historical topics. He has voiced his opinions outside of academic circles, thus making them, as the OP has pointed out, an editorial. It has to be judged as that. Using his reputation as an academic and constructing a master narrative of striving for ideals is a contradiction in itself. The master narrative he employs to underline his beliefs is too simple to be a valid academic evaluation. He might very well express a more complex and balanced view in his book, but then he has misjudged the medium of a newspaper. He can not expect people to be aware that the brief summary of his book is an oversimplification. In misjudging the medium he misleads the readers into thinking his statements are supported by academic methodology. Wheter intentional or not, his comment was therefore not well placed. But it is not surprising, since he is entitled to his opinions as a human being, and is also entitled to voice them publicly, given the opportunity. Conveying the complexity of academic thought and reasoning is a very difficult task indeed, so using academic statements in public debate becomes very difficult. Maybe Zinn would have been better off, if he had pointed out to the editor, that he was overstepping the mark of his acadamic remit in his statements, but wanted to voice personal opinion, but maybe he did, and it did not make the editorial cut. We can only speculate on that, so i would be careful in ragging on him too much. \\n tl;dr: Summarizing complex, academic thought is difficult \\n',\n  0),\n (\"There seem to be two parts to your question: \\n \\n Why did Hitler revise the campaign objectives to include the capture of Stalingrad? \\n \\n Why did Germany and the USSR continue to commit so many resources to the fight even after the costs of doing so were evident? \\n \\n \\n Cutting Soviet lines of communication along the Volga by capturing Stalingrad would have been a major blow to the USSR by disrupting the flow of oil from the Caucasus and complicating delivery of lend-lease supplies.  However, denying the oil fields to the Soviets was not Germany’s primary strategic goal in 1942.   Instead, the goal was to capture the oil fields for Germany’s own use.  [From Fuhrer Directive 41, Hitler’s initial orders for the 1942 campaign:]( \\n > All available forces will be concentrated on the main operations in the southern sector, with the aim of destroying the enemy before the Don River, in order to secure the Caucasian oil fields and the passes through the Caucasus mountains themselves. \\n The capture of Stalingrad was not a key objective of this original plan.  The thrust of the plan was for German forces to encircle and destroy Soviet forces around Voronezh and along the Don, which the Germans believed would open the road to the Caucasus.  Advancing on Stalingrad was a secondary objective in order to cut the Volga and to destroy factories in the city, but taking the city itself was not identified as critical: \\n > The third attack in the course of these operations will be so conducted that formations thrusting down the Don River can link up in the Stalingrad area with forces advancing from the Taganrog-Artelnovsk area between the lower waters of the Don River and Voroshilovgrad across the Donets River to the east. These forces should finally establish contact with the armored forces advancing on Stalingrad. \\n > Should opportunities arise during these operations, particularly by the capture of undemolished bridges, to establish bridgeheads to the east or south of the Don River, advantage will be taken of them. In any event, every effort will be made to reach Stalingrad itself, or at least to bring the city under fire from heavy artillery so that it may no longer be of any use as an industrial or communications center. \\n In July, Hitler expands the objectives of the campaign to include the capture of Stalingrad, as well as the capture of the entire Black Sea coastline and the western Caucuses.  There are strategic rationales offered for each.  In the case of Stalingrad, Hitler wants to cut the Volga, but he also identifies a need to strengthen the German position along the Don and to destroy concentrating Soviet forces that might threaten the Army's flanks. [Fuhrer Directive 45 lays out the new objectives:]( \\n > In a campaign which has lasted little more than three weeks, the broad objectives outlined by me for the southern flank of the Eastern front have been largely achieved. Only weak enemy forces from the Timoshenko Army Group have succeeded in avoiding encirclement and reaching the further bank of the Don. We must expect them to be reinforced from the Caucasus. A further concentration of enemy forces is taking place in the Stalingrad area, which the enemy will probably defend tenaciously. \\n > The next task of Army Group A is to encircle enemy forces which have escaped across the Don in the area south and southeast of Rostov, and to destroy them. … After the destruction of enemy forces south of the Don,  the most important task of Army Group A will be to occupy the ; entire eastern coastline of the Black Sea, thereby eliminating the Black Sea ports and the enemy Black Sea fleet. … At the same time a force composed chiefly of fast-moving formations\\nwill give flank cover in the east and capture the Grozny area. … Thereafter the Baku area will be occupied by a thrust along the Caspian coast. \\n > The task of Army Group B is, as previously laid down, to develop the Don defenses and, by a thrust forward to Stalingrad, to smash the enemy forces concentrated there, to occupy the town, and to block the land communications between the Don and the Volga, as well as the Don itself. \\n Implicit in these new goals are the recognition that the Soviet ability to resist has not been destroyed according to  plan and overconfidence in the German Army’s ability to finish the job.  The German Army so far has had stunning success breaking through Soviet defenses and assumed it was only a matter of time before the Soviets collapsed for good.  However, the Germans consistently underestimated the forces available to the Soviets.  Hitler also fails to recognize that overextended supply lines were a major factor in German failure to pin down Soviet forces so far, a problem that would only get worse.  Finally, Hitler convinced himself that troops from Germany's allies—Italy, Romania, Hungary and Croatia—would adequately substitute for inadequate German force strength, which was a disastrous mistake. \\n The net result is that the strategic vision for the campaign becomes muddy.  It's not clear that capturing the oil fields was ever a viable objective for the Germans, given the distances involved and the Germans' inadequate force strength and supply network.  The revised plan probably ruined whatever chance the Germans had, however, by diluting already-thin German forces along two distinct axes of advance. \\n Obviously, the Germans then fail to capture Stalingrad.  So why do both sides commit so many forces and sacrifice such huge numbers in the ensuing battle?   The Soviet side is easier to understand—as others mentioned, losing the supply lines up the Volga would be disastrous.  Stalin issues Order 227, “No One Step Backwards,” and the Soviets dig in along the river.  As early as September, they also recognize that keeping the Germans pinned down in the city creates opportunities for counteroffensives, which eventually becomes Operation Uranus. \\n The German decision to remain committed is harder to understand.  Propaganda and the name probably play a role.  However, I think the better explanation is that it’s very difficult under the best of circumstances for commanders to recognize when they’ve made a strategic error and to correct it.  Once forces are committed, it becomes harder and harder to admit the original plan was flawed or that the effort was wasted.  That dynamic is reflected in both Stalin and Hitler’s repeated refusal to let their armies retreat, even when doing so would have preserved forces for use in stronger defensive positions. \\n The result in this case is tunnel vision about capturing the city.  If the Germans’ operating assumption is that the Soviets are on the verge of defeat and running out of reserves, than victory is always just one push away.  The balance of costs vs. benefits or alternative approaches are not considered.  Even commanders that recognized the risks were unwilling or unable to get their voices heard.  After the Soviet breakthrough, the command climate around Hitler becomes increasingly surreal as Hitler convinces himself the Sixth Army can be supplied by air and that adequate forces exist to regain the German's original line. \\n TL:DR – Early successes in the 1942 campaign led Hitler to order the capture of Stalingrad in order to destroy Soviet Forces and cut Soviet supply lines.  However, he overestimated the German Army’s capacity to accomplish the objective.  Once committed, he refused to admit his error and instead continued to reinforce failure, condemning the Sixth Army to destruction. \\n Key Sources: \\n Antony Beevor,  Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege: 1942-1943 \\n Williamson Murray, Allan R.

If there is any work, command me; I will follow your order [ imperium ].\" \\n and the power/right to give commands: \\n > Jubeo hercle, si quid imperii est in te mihi \\n\"I do indeed command you, if I do have the right to do so [ imperii ] to you.\" \\n These are its two most basic meanings. \\n Importantly, the word implies a bestowed power, not an innate or inherited one. The kings of Rome held  imperium , acknowledging the unspoken contract to rule absolutely. It could also be used of various officials in the later Repulic and into the Empire; a provincial governor was legally bestowed  imperium  and it could be just as legally revoked. By extension,  imperium  could refer to region over which an official exerted control, or even the entirety of the Roman lands. However, it\\'s use was not limited to what we consider the Roman \"Empire.\" Cicero, during the late Republic, often used it to refer to all of Rome: \\n > finium imperii nostri propagatio \\n\"an expansion of our realm\\'s boundaries\" \\n And while use of  imperium  does increase after Augustus\\' reign, there is no demarcation of \"here is the  imperium,  before it was not.\" \\n Why does it increase then? Well, the related word  imperator  referred to the top military commander up until the first few decades A.D., and  imperium  often meant specifically his authority. You may recognize this word as the source of our \"emperor;\" and it was indeed one title claimed by the emperor. By the end of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, it was almost exclusively reserved for the  Caesar.  Thus, the unspecified, concrete  imperium  more frequently referred to the  imperator \\'s  imperium.  Many political crises began when the legions bestowed  imperium  on a favored individual. But as before, the  imperator  title is not inherently associated with the Roman Empire. Augustus, upon consolidating the offices of many former officials, took the title  princeps  for his newly created position. If there is any word that signaled the new era of Rome, it was this. \\n TL;DR : The best English equivalent for \"empire\" saw growth during the first few decades after Augustus until it took on its full imperial implications. However, it was used before Augustus with more or less the same meaning, and its use afterwards was still as a concrete extension of the abstract authority of  imperium . \\n If you want to learn more, U Chicago\\'s Logeion is a great resource for uses of Latin [words]( \\n',\n  0),\n (\"Prior to the 1700s Europeans didn't have sugar in their diet so they didn't lose their teeth like Europeans in the eighteenth century onward.

Small enterprises and co-ops (ran by politicians) may be given some extra-benefits over privately run large corporations.  \\n To protect people from themselves . For example, young people are stupid and should neither drink or drive. All people are weak, so selling drugs (both medical and mind-altering) should be heavily regulated or outright banned.  \\n Public pressure due to individual incident that is unlikely to happen again .

However, how can you exclude the retardedness (let alone evilness) of the Indian caste system as a factor in its weakness and poverty? \\n The explanation you give is a technical blow-by-blow of how the British hosed the Indians in relatively recent history. You do not ask why was this possible or why has it not recovered? India was not the only nation raped by the Europeans. China was just as, if not more so savaged. Other nations were just as vulnerable as India.  Many have recovered much more quickly and much more rigorously.  Germany, Japan, Korea, China, Brazil, and many others have come from being war torn, utterly destroyed, genocided, and more but have had much better recoveries. \\n So while what you are saying is interesting, you don't look at the root cause. India has a long history of being retarded. She wastes vast amounts of her people's talents by having the opposite of a meritocracy.  Sure - castes exist in other places - but not to the extent it does in India. \\n I believe individual Indians can be extremely talented and gifted.

A good comparison is that of  Gone With The Wind  (1940) to  Pinky  (1949). GWTW had a classic black 'mammy', who was only interested in caring for her white mistress with plenty of over-the-top lines.  Pinky  was the story of a black girl who could pass for being white and her efforts to do so. It was still pretty racist - the moral was that she should just accept that she's black and stop trying to hide from her 'true nature', it's a quantum leap away from the oldest stereotypes. \\n Sidney Poitier, in the 1960s, reinforced the change with a series of roles in which he played complex and diverse characters. He won an Oscar in 1963, and was one of the biggest and most bankable stars of the decade. In  The Heat Of The Night  (1967) he even got to slap a white southerner for his racism. That said, for all this was a break with the bestial / entertainer stereotypes, he was still in an odd position - all his characters had to be unrealistically good. For example, in  Guess Who's Coming To Dinner , his prospective white parents-in-law begin to thaw when they discover he is a Harvard graduate doctor with experience in charitable foundations, the WHO  and  research hospitals, all at the age of 33. Essentially, to be acceptable, he has to be hilariously good at everything he does. In 1967, however, Cliford Mason published 'Why do White Americans Love Sidney Poitier So?', attacking him for being a sellout and hiding his civil rights background. Much of Poitier's work in the 1970s is a response to this. \\n Even after Poitier, Blaxploitation reverted to stereotype. It's hard to say Shaft or Sweet Sweetback are not bestial. Worse still, blaxploitation was ultimately controlled by white studios - Richard Roundtree, who played Shaft, was grossly underpaid, even in the sequels. The film itself was written and directed by whites. \\n Moving into the present day, it's still the case that there are very few films that give the same care and attention to black characters than white characters. Spike Lee is perhaps the only major director to make serious films about the black experience in America. For the most part, black actors are comic relief, loyal sidekicks or, in Lee's critique, 'Magic Negroes' - a mysterious character with little back stry who appears simply to pass on mystical knowledge to help the white character achieve their goal. Black characters nowadays are generally assumed to be from the 'hood, versed in rap and possessed of street smarts. Equally, it's deeply unusual for a black make character to have a white leading lady. That said, things are better - in particular, actors like Donald Glover are helping to push new, more nuanced perceptions. \\n Ultimately, it's less that portrayals of racism changed than racism itself changed. Hollywood deals in stereotypes, and society began to stereotype blacks in different ways. Hollywood is less racist than in the 1930s, and that's brilliant, but it's still a pretty difficult environment for blacks, in part reflecting the continued issue of racism in society. \\n TL;DR: probably in the 1940s, but mostly because racism itself changed, not films. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('As you say in your description the American involvement in Russia was part of an Allied Intervention into Russia rather than an actual invasion. President Wilson authorised limited military force in Russia but no formal declaration of war was ever authorised by the American Congress. Wilson ordered 5,000 men to occupy Arkhangelsk and around 8,000 to Vladivostok, a port city on the far eastern reaches of Russia. The American \"expeditionary\" forces were not part of a concerted American war effort but rather an American commitment made out of the emerging European debates that followed the First World War. Wilson was also known to use limited occupational forces to achieve political goals. One example is his 1914 occupation of the Mexican port city Veracruz to influence the success of a U.S. friendly Mexican government, obviously Veracruz is a different story but it demonstrates that Wilson used Executive power to authorise military occupations that were not necessarily outright invasions or declarations of war. \\n Importantly the number of around 13,000 thousand American soldiers was considerably less than the commitments of Czechoslovakia\\'s (50,000), France\\'s (12,000) and Britain\\'s (40,000). Moreover the strategic importance of the areas occupied by America were also minor in comparison to other zones of conflict and the role of America was manifestly less significant than the contributions of her Allies. General Graves who commanded the American contingent present in Siberia (American Expeditionary Force Siberia) had the aim of protecting American military equipment and American capital investment that was still in Russia after the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II. Graves\\' other objectives included safe guarding the exit of the Czech legion from Russian territory and to assist the reorganisation of the new Russian government. \\n You have to take into account that Russia in 1918 was vastly different from the Communist state that we understand it to have been throughout the twentieth century. In 1918 it was not clear that the Bolsheviks would emerge as victors, the Red Army faced opponents on four fronts to control a comparatively small area compared to the huge country we know Russia is today. The map I\\'ve linked at the bottom shows the extent of Bolshevik control in 1919, Archangelsk is just at the top, Vladivostok where most of the Americans were stationed is located thousands of kilometers to the east and Americans stationed there engaged in a limited role against Russian Cossacks, a group separate to the Revolutionary Bolsheviks. \\n Wilson\\'s motivations for sending American troops were numerous but stemmed from his willingness to see through his own vision for a post war peace process. He was pressured by allies to commit to Russian intervention and he likely did so in a diplomatic measure to ensure he had some leverage in the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. Undoubtedly Wilson was more concerned with fostering a democratic environment in Europe (and protecting physical American interests in Russia) rather than in participating in a huge mobilisation against Russia after the toll of the First World War. This fits in with the second part of your question where you ask if regular American\\'s knew about the Russian Intervention. The intervention was certainly no secret, Congressmen, Newspapers and Citizens were alert to the experiences of American soldiers stationed in the frozen port cities and campaigned for the men to be returned. Generally Americans opposed intervention and largely felt that their commitment in the First World War had been sufficient enough in aiding allied European nations. Additionally many Americans did not share the international spirit that Wilson pushed in the post-war peace conferences. President Warren Harding who followed Wilson\\'s administration condemned the intervention as a complete mistake. \\n Here are a couple of good sources if you want to develop some of the ideas that I\\'ve written here, hope this helps you settle your bets! \\n TL;DR It wasn\\'t an invasion, it was an intervention authorised by the President and not Congress and the American people knew about it. \\n Maybe the best quick read to get the bet settled that isn\\'t a wikipedia article \\n The introduction here will help you get a better idea on some of the context surrounding the intervention. \\n *edit: fixed a few sentences for clarity \\n',\n  0),\n (\"The Causes of War , by Geoffrey Blainey, makes the case that the longest sustained periods of peace in the past 300 years have been when one country was powerful enough that no one else wanted to mess with it. Great Britain after the Napoleonic Wars, for instance. \\n His thesis was basically that no one goes into a war that they don't think they can win. If I remember, his study of documents, diplomatic cables, news articles, etc. found only three examples of wars, regardless of who attacked whom first, in which both sides didn't start out thinking they'd win. A country that thinks it would lose a war generally backs down from a conflict before it comes to that. \\n When one country is powerful enough that it could beat anyone else, and everyone else knows it, the world tends to be peaceful. No one attacks the powerful country and the powerful country has an incentive to keep the rest relatively peaceful in order to preserve the status quo. \\n According to Blainey, those periods of peace come to an end when that country's power has declined relative to its rivals. Then you get a situation like Europe in the beginning of the 20th century, where Great Britain is still convinced of its own power but other countries, like Germany, have become powerful enough that they think Great Britain is overconfident. Eventually some conflict arises, and with both sides convinced that they'll do fine if war comes, neither is willing to back down. Then the war happens, and afterwords everyone has a much better idea of who could beat up whom. \\n TL;DR  Unipolar = most peaceful, although definitely not best for autonomy. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\">The Greeks accepted bisexuality - that men and women could enjoy both homoseuxal and heterosexual lovemaking. Homosexual relationships normally carried no social stigma. \\n This is complete bullshit. \\n Male 'homosexuality' - in the sense of 'a love affair between equals of the same gender' was  extremely  stigmatized in almost all the Greek sources we know.  The Greeks, like the Romans, defined sex in terms of penetration and reception, not the gender of the partners, and  to be penetrated  was  always  shameful - it was, in fact, the defining characteristic of women to be penetrated, and typified the inferior social status of that gender.  As such, it was acceptable for an adult male citizen to penetrate women, slaves, and children, because they were of lower social status; but for two adult male citizens to have a sexual relationship was held in great contempt, because, it was believed, one of them would  have  to take the receptive role, and so shame and degrade himself.  Aristophanes, in particular, amuses himself by accusing prominent Athenians of 'taking it'. \\n The archetypical Greek 'homosexual' relationship was that between an adult male and a young citizen boy, and while this sort of relationship was tolerate - and even praised in some contexts - there was a particular set of rules the relationship had to follow.  The adult male was expected to sexually desire the younger boy; the boy, on the other hand, was  not  to desire the adult male (because it was assumed that the social superior, the adult, would take the 'male' role, and to desire the feminine role was beneath the dignity of a future citizen).  He was to  tolerate  the man's advances and endure them (and actual penetration was very much shunned in a relationship like this; intercrual sex, 'rubbing' between the boy's thighs, would be typical) in exchange for gifts, education, and the benefit of the older man's wisdom and social connections.  In Athens, this tradition was - possibly - part of the education of the citizen boy, an introduction to political alliances and the society of men; in the Spartan  agoge , an older homoioi would take a new recruit 'under his wing', so to speak; in the Sacred Band of Thebes, young boys and older warriors were paired as shieldmates, and fought all the harder, so the stories go, so as not to shame themselves before their lover/beloved. \\n As for Greek lesbianism, it's an extremely complicated topic - there's a  lot  of argument about Sappho - but, in the surviving sources  other  than Sappho, female-female sexuality barely appears at all - far less prominent than male-male sexuality - and when it does, it's generally treated as something humorous or grotesque, eg, vase paintings featuring one woman with an enormously oversized clitoris penetrating another, rather than the sort of 'genuine' relationships we see valorized between men in Plato's  Symposium ... \\n tl;dr:  your book is bullshitting you. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('Before anyone can really answer this question it seems necesary that everyone understand how military ranks and promotions work in the US armed forces (I\\'m going to speak to the U.S. army because that\\'s what I\\'m familiar with). \\n So you have enlisted soldiers (Private through Seargant MAjor) and commisioned officers (Second Lieutenant through General of the Army). To enlist all one needed to do was simply show up at a recruiting center and provide proof of age (sometimes as little as a singed affidavit) and pass a medical screening. Once selected the soldier would be sent to one of many basic training centers depending on what their job would be. Officers had to either atend a service academy, graduate from ROTC or attend OCS and all would be commisioned as 2LTs. \\n Once basic training was complete the soldier would be sent to whatever unit they would serve with. Now for a soldier who enlisted in 1942 and served all the way until 1945, especially in a combat unit, it would be very difficult for them not to get prmoted. Battelefield promotions for enlistedmen were not uncommon or difficult because promotion from Private through Staff Seargant are handled at the battalion level, meaning that a Liutenant Colonel could promote that soldier. For ranks higher than staff seargant higher boards were required to promote Non-commisioned officers (Seargants through Seargants Major) but that still is not necessarily very difficult. \\n Officer promoitions were not uncommon or particularly difficult on the batlefield either, at least at company grade (Second Lietenant thorugh Captain). In the Army Air-Corps officer promotions could come incredibly quickly because of the incredible casualty rates (going on 30% if I remeber correctly for most air wings) so there were full bird colonels commanding air groups who hadn\\'t yet turned 30. \\n What was somewhat uncommon and difficult were Battlefield commisions, when an enlistedman gets commissioned as an officer in theatre and without atteneding one of the aformentioned commissioning routes. These were reserved for exemplarly soldiers (think Audi Murphy). I believe this is what you were actually referring to and of the 4 million men who served only 25,000 recieved commisions via this method. \\n As far as how a soldier would recieve word of their promotion this would very but traditionaly the soldier would have a brief promotion ceremony within their company and obbisouly rthe higher their rank the bigger a deal it would have been. Orders would have to be published for each promotion but this would have been routine clerical work that would be maintained by battalion staff. If a commander chose to he could promote a soldier \"on the line\" as it were so it would not necessarliy have to take place \"back at base\". \\n TL;DR Most soldiers who served in combat probably recieved at least one battelfield promotion, battlefield commisions though were much more uncommon. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Though even today intentional efforts to cause rain by means of cloud seeding are of inconclusive effectiveness, it may have been that the large quantities of artillery fire used actually seeded rain to fall onto the battlefields.

It\\'s out of my area of expertise, but it\\'s important enough to warrant speedy attention, in my opinion. \\n This doesn\\'t answer your question as such, but what is implied in your problem is the distinction between slavery and free or wage labour not always being as clear-cut as we might think. I can\\'t speak for other slave societies, but this distinction was often not clear in colonial America. Apprentices, chattel slaves, and indentured servants were a part of everyday life and all owed (for lack of a better word) a master of some sort forced labour. Freely working for wages with the right to choose an employer, rather than under the authority of the state and master, did not at this point necessarily appear distinct from some of these forms of forced labour. What we understand today as working for wages wasn\\'t a major part of the economy and didn\\'t exist as a clear-cut concept separate from slavery. Independence meant owning property and self-employment (to use a anachronistic term) rather than working for an employer. Your \\'good \"slave owners\"\\' only existed here in the sense that the distinction between freedom and slavery could be quite blurred in early America for a large number of indentured workers, household servants, apprentices, and journeymen. It\\'s also worth noting at this point slavery is already racialised, with indentured servants generally being white and chattel slaves generally being black. If you want to read more, Edmund Morgan\\'s  American Slavery, American Freedom  and David Davis\\'s  The Problem of Slavery  would be recommended reading (and available in any university library). Christopher Tomlins\\'s  Freedom Bound  is very comprehensive but very, very dense. \\n What\\'s important here is not to think that in nineteenth-century America there were \\'good \"slave owners\"\\' who treated African-Americans well on their plantations. (I saw this idea hiding behind the question and this is why I responded to it). Slaveowners did claim to be benevolent masters to their feminine, childlike (or so they claimed) slaves, and they probably believed it. Slavery, though, was universally brutal. If you read Davis or Morgan, you\\'ll see how the growth of slavery required Americans to dehumanise their African-American slaves. At the mid-nineteenth slavery, I\\'m not convinced even slaveholders who saw themselves as good paternal masters could divorce chattel slavery from the whip and holding absolute authority over their slaves - which excludes the idea of a master considering slaves as people. This was an institution built on the lash, slave patrols, bans on teaching African-Americans to read, censorship of abolitionist material in the mail, pass laws, censorship of abolitionist petitions to Congress, bans on freeing slaves, paranoia at the threat of a Haiti-style slave revolt. Even if a master wanted to be a \\'good master\\' in the way you might be envisioning, slavery was totalitarian off the plantation as well as totalitarian on the plantation. Southern society would have considered a \\'good \"slave owner\"\\' that I think you\\'re describing an ideological threat to the southern slave system, and would not have tolerated it. \\n tl/dr: In colonial America the distinction between freedom and slavery was distinct and opened the door for halfway houses between them. But in the nineteenth-century South, despite slaveholders believing themselves paternalistic and benevolent, slavery was a system that in its very nature excluded the idea of such a \\'good master.\\' Nineteenth-century American slavery demanded slaves not be considered as people. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"This depends entirely on your point of view: it's either from the very beginning in 1939, or in 1941 with the failure of the capture of Moscow during operation typhoon. \\n Wages of destruction by Adam Tooze offers some pretty good reason for this. The economic balance of power was always very much against Germany once war broke out. Even in 1940, the UK and France was outproducing Germany in terms of war materials (i.e in terms of warplanes). Also the Nazis were chronically short on raw material and lack the means of importing them from oversea sources (To give you some idea of how bad this was, Germany was almost out of bombs following the invasion of Poland) whereas the Allies had the resources of the entire colonial empire to draw on. Meaning that any real war of attrition or long term war was going to result in German defeat. \\n So what the Germans needed to do is not to wait for a war of production to occur, but to push forward with the conquest of new territories as fast as possible in order to secure new resources and to knock out opponents before they can translate their economic potential into military power. \\n To this end, daring Blitzkrieg attacks were the optimal strategy, as shown in the invasion of Poland, France and the first 6 month of the invasion of Soviet Union. The Germans also enjoyed very good luck (i.e much of the French airforce was grounded for maintenance during the first phase of the invasion of France), and very very bad planning on the part of the Allies (i.e during the invasion of France the French rushed armored divisions into Belgium, walking right into a German encirclement) that made it very successful during the first stage of the war. \\n However, the problem with this strategy was that it depended very much on momentum, the moment when a conquest is stalled or failed, the house of cards starts to collapse because the war turns from a rapid war of maneuver and encirclement into a slow war of grinding attrition and production. I cannot stress how important this is because Germany's opponents to both the east and the west was growing stronger faster than it was. There was therefore, a limited window of opportunity to launch a successful invasion. Delaying the invasion of the Soviet Union by a year for instance, would have meant the Red Army recovers more from Stalin's purges and fix the problems it was shown to have during the Winter war with Finland which drastically decreases German chance of success. \\n As an aside, the invasion of the British isles was never a serious option for the Germans with any possibility of success. \\n And a stalled conquest is exactly what happened in 1941, the German failure to capture Moscow when it invaded the Soviet Union. German forces stalled in front of Moscow in December 1941 and subsequent Soviet counter attacks drove it from the gates of the Soviet capital. By failing to do so, it failed to knock out the Soviet out of the war and was therefore forced into a war of production. The declaration of war on the US in 1941 after Pearl harbor did not help in that regard. \\n Thereafter, despite retaining control of most of Europe, the Nazis was unable to mobilize the full extent of industry because Europe lacked natural resources to do so. The chronic shortage of oil, Bauxite among other materials mean that many factories in occupied territory lie idle. There are a lot of myth regarding the fact that Germany did not go on war economy until it was too late while in reality the truth was that Germany was -unable- to mobilize the full economic potential of its occupied territories. \\n By Paul Kennedy's calculation, the US alone possessed over 50% of overall war-making powers (industry, manpower etc) in the world in 1941, combined with Soviet and British production, it was only a matter of time until Germany was grinded down by superior economic power. For a while, Germany retained an advantage in being the most experienced of the combatants with the best quality army, but that started to disappear as the Red Army started to gain more experience and Germany's best divisions was destroyed on the Eastern front. It was able to achieve important tactical success on all fronts (i.e 3rd Kharkov, Kasserine Pass), but those were never enough to change the balance of power int he war. The rest is, as we say, history, as the allies defeated Germany and occupied it. \\n Had the Germans taken Moscow in 1941, it would have captured an important center of transportation, it would have dislocated the Soviet planning bureaucracy which made its economy work, and most importantly it might have caused a political collapse within the Communist party of the Soviet Union, which might have destroyed the Soviet war effort. Once it occupied enough of the Soviet Union, it might have being able to acquire enough natural resources to mobilize the industry of Europe and transfer enough divisions to the west to prevent an Anglo-American landing. But even that is a pretty long shot because chances are the Soviet Union will not collapse following the loss of Moscow. \\n The Nazi regime was pretty inefficient and there was a lot of stuff they could have done better (i.e rationalize the production process instead of having an ad-hoc allocation of raw material among its industries), but none of it as enough to fundamentally alter the economic balance of power. \\n tl;dr Germany was a the equivalent of a RTS player whose entire build was to go for a one base all in tank rush while everyone else had economic builds, as soon as the tank rush starts to fail loss is inevitable. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('Jihad is mentioned in the Quran which was written in the early 7th century AD/CE by Muhammad, nearly 500 years before Pope Urban II called the Crusades in 1095. \\n The word \"jihad\" means \"to struggle/resist\", but the definition is definitely vague as muslim scholars and historians have argued over it\\'s meaning in the past. \\n In context with the Islamic Classical Law, it refers to the struggle a muslim should have against those who do not believe in Allah and do not acknowledge submission to muslims. \\n I think i\\'ve rambled a bit here, ill get back to the question. \\n No, the muslim Jihad\\'s occurred centuries before the Catholic Crusades and where targeted at spreading the word of Allah through whatever means necessary.

The French, too, didn't finish their mobilization until around mid-September, which is also too late. The Polish campaign was all but over by then.

There are varying schools of thought on its long term effects: some argue that it allowed Nixon to stave off stagflation in the short-term (until Carter got stuck with it, anyway); some argue that dropping the Gold Standard  caused  stagflation; and still others argue that the credit-based economy that the US has become can be linked, directly or indirectly, to the good times of the 80s and 90s. But you\\'re probably wondering: what makes this change so important? \\n Basically, the Gold Standard was what ensured US dominance on the world markets. Well, that and World War II, but that\\'s a whole other conversation. For all intents and purposes what you should know (and this will, in a roundabout fashion, answer your question) is that the Gold Standard was actually a major  cause  of the Great Depression. At the end of World War I, Germany was devastated economically (revolutions tend to do that), France was saddled with huge debts in rebuilding whole sections of their country, Britain was struggling to stay afloat with its loss of trading partners, etc, etc. Not helping this at ALL were the reparations payments that Germany was stuck with, which led to a disastrous chain of events from 1920-1925. Basically Germany had no money to pay back France or Britain, so the French sent troops into the demilitarized coal- and iron- rich Ruhr to force Germany to pay up. While German workers in the Ruhr resisted, the government in Berlin tried as hard as it could to scrape up the money, making the catastrophic mistake of printing more money.  Lots  more money. But the gold standard dictated that \"x\" amount of money could be exchanged into \"y\" amount of gold and vice versa. But when there\\'s a very small gold reserve and a ton of paper money on the market, as in Germany in 1923, the worth of that paper money falls through the floor, and that\\'s exactly what happened to Germany. At the same time, even the Allied powers of the war had been forced to borrow money from the US after 1914 and were faced with their own slowly-diminishing gold reserves as they tried to pay back their debts. Things became very precarious and it appeared for a time that France might just unilaterally invade Germany to forcibly extract the payments. So the US stepped in. \\n Since world markets are based off of money  circulation , not aggregate wealth, an Allied Committee under Charles Dawes set up a plan to counteract the walls springing up and get payments flowing again. The Dawes Plan, as it came to be known, basically worked like this: the US gives money to Germany so Germany can give money to France and Britain so that they can give money to the US. It was basically a con job, but it gave the German  Deutschmark  a certain amount of solvency and allowed them to start exchanging their reparations payments (punishable by war) for loans (punishable by interest). While it didn\\'t fix the cause of the problem, the Dawes Plan set things in motion again...at least until 1929. \\n The reason the Great Depression got so bad so quickly was basically  because  of the Gold Standard. When the crash of October 27-November 2, 1929 took place, the United States held huge sections of the world\\'s gold reserves - a vast majority if I remember correctly, though I don\\'t have numbers on hand. This meant that though other countries needed US investment badly, the isolationist policies designed to help American manufacturers and farmers inadvertently screwed everyone over. Other countries had badly inflated currencies because they could no longer value against American reserves so easily (the Dawes Plan folded and Germany\\'s solvency went down the drain again), and US domestic production was crushed by a lack of buyers. The Young Plan designed to permanently alleviate the reparations question never went into practice, though doing so might have actually stripped the Nazis of a lot of their credibility in talking about Versailles and the \"crushing burden of reparations\". But that\\'s just another might-have-been. \\n tl;dr: the Gold Standard was a major cause of the Great Depression, or at least of its exacerbation. Also, the USA didn\\'t go off the Gold Standard until 1971. \\n Also, an interesting footnote here. One of the first governments to pull off the Gold Standard was the Nazis in the mid-30s, mainly to finance their huge coming rearmament programs. Through some clever currency manipulation by a man named Hjalmar Schacht, the German government gave the world economy the shaft (I\\'m hilarious) by making up how much money it had and basing it off of confidence and generally dicking around with the numbers. This is one of the first and most successful instances of a credit economy in practice, and it actually is one of the forerunners of the modern US and world currency systems. \\n You might want to ask [r/economics]( if you want to know more about these things. \\n',\n  0),\n ('I think I am suited to help you there a little bit.

About a year ago a did a student\\'s paper on social revolutionary activism in Great Britain or more precisely the lack of it and the remarkable dominance of reformism in British politics. I am currently working on expanding it into a proper paper for my Bachelor\\'s thesis. \\n The lack of anarchist terrorist networks in Great Britain in the 1880s and 1890s, while anarchist bombings were ravaging European capitals and heads of state were assassinated, was a major obstacle for my work at first. (I started out to research  propaganda by deed  in the UK.) But only until I began to revolve my research around the phenomenon of its absence. \\n However, over the course of my research I did come across one extensive work on the subject: John Quail\\'s  The Slow Burning Fuse. The Lost History of the British Anarchists  anarchist scene in the late 19th and early 20th century. Unfortunately I stumbled upon the book only relatively late, as I had switched my focus slightly and went too far into the other direction already. So it never became a pillar of my work and I only skimmed it partly and never had the time to pick it up again since then. \\n What I do know, is that the British anarchist scene in the late 19th century remained a marginal one compared to its French or Spanish counterparts, and a remarkably non-violent one. That being said, there was a significant network of sympathizers and supporters in London, who where instrumental in harboring the numerous fugitive anarchists, radical thinkers and even outright terrorists, who were exiled or fled from the continent. \\n That was mainly the case because British free speech and extradition laws were designed to protect exiled foreigners. (The UK has a long standing tradition of political asylum to this day.) The freedom of press allowed the further distribution of political pamphlets and journals targeting their special audience. -- For example the German radical left-wing, partially anarchist newspaper  Freiheit  was at times printed in London and shipped secretly to Germany. The  Freiheit\\'s  publisher and preeminent brain Johann Most was a political refugee, who spend considerable time in London (and later on the US). \\n If you choose to set your RPG in London\\'s anarchist/radical left-wing/social revolutionary scene (they overlapped partially), you would have to paint a small, conspiratorial scene, where people know each other at least fleetingly most of the time, and where connections are everything. A considerable part of the characters involved would be foreigners, preferably continental European, always on the go, still heavily involved with sympathizers and terrorist circles \"at home\" and always scheming, scheming, scheming. Undercover agents of their home countries and of the British police would be somewhat common (perhaps a good character premise), and the anarchists were always trying to be alert of infiltration. However, they would for the most part be hesitant to harm Great Britain herself, as she was their sanctuary.

This would weaken the enemy's center; Napoleon would then begin massing his artillery and concentrating his main infantry-and-or-cavalry to assault the now undermanned center.  By taking the center, often where the opposing army's headquarters were, essentially all enemy units would be rendered ineffective in coordination after the battle.  This worked brilliantly against the coalition forces at Austerlitz but failed disastrously at Waterloo principally due to Wellington's conservative nature in using his reserves and the timely arrival of Prussian reinforcements. \\n The more relevant example of post-battle pursuit would be after the French victory at the Battle of Jena.  Napoleon rapidly sent his various corps to assault key forts, garrisons and armories in quick succession which led to tens of thousands captured, hundreds of thousands muskets confiscated and over a thousand cannons taken.  This crippled Prussia's western forces and immediately shifted the war east to Prussia's Polish territories were Russia was finally beginning to mobilize. \\n I think it's important to point out how radical this method was for the period.  This was a stark change from when monarchs would sue for peace after a relatively isolated but disastrous battle or campaign for the exchange of a few regional conclaves or monetary compensation.  Napoleon's pursuit after Jena was a dramatic shift in European diplomacy which saw that being a defeated nation was not a temporary financial setback but threatened annihilation of the state itself.  War itself was being less of an economic tool and more a diplomatic weapon and the simplest diplomacy is done by an victorious power against an unarmed state. \\n tl:dr - Napoleon actively sought to fight and win battles of annihilation.  This was different from most earlier battles where simply taking the field was enough to warrant being called a victory, even if casualties were similar. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"I'm not sure that the idea that people were bored of the harpsichord sound has much basis in history. If that was the case what about drums? Wouldn't we be bored of them by now? \\n The demands for broader dynamic range (loud/soft) is how Norton's Anthology of Music describes the demise of the harpsichord. Musical ensembles grew and became more complex, especially with the growing use of brass and percussion instruments so as a practical matter you needed to make sure other instruments wouldn't be drowned out. With stringed instruments you just add more, but it's tough to add many more harpsichords to the mix. \\n As all this was developing you also had the beginnings of program music where composers sought greater control over the end product by writing in more precise instructions. The earliest examples are dynamic indicators to tell musicians when to play louder or softer. Eventually these instructions would become much more descriptive. A la marcha, andante, majestuoso, and on and on. It's already been mentioned but a harpsichord has very limited dynamic range so it's harder to accomplish all this. \\n Tl;dr: it's tough to rock out on a harpsichord.

However, the British refused to do so thus infuriating the French.  British reasons for this were attributed to paranoia because of French control of the Low Countries - which only a century prior had been the staging ground for the last invasion of the islands, the Glorious Revolution.  There was a quid pro quo mentality in the British sphere in which France should release the Low Countries in exchange for Malta but, meh, Brits. \\n So Napoleon, not taking the British \\n So Austria and Russia also join the Third Coalition.  Russia is a far in Eastern Europe but has a vested interest in western affairs.  This led to an alliance with Austria to beat back the upstart Napoleon. \\n Now comes in the two German states, Prussia and Austria.  Both are considered the premier German powers with the potential to rule over all of Germany.  At this time, the idea of Germany was massive, which stretched from Hanover to Venice and from Alsaces-Lorraine to Poland.  A united Germany would have possessed a massive population and enormous natural resources.  Prussia, skeptical of Austria's post-war intentions in splitting the spoils - decide that pursuing a Pro-French option may be viable and thus stay neutral until a clear victor is decided. \\n Austria was one of the fiercest opponents in the Republican French state.  Napoleon's vain coronation of himself as Emperor did not help paint them in a better light.  Humiliated by the losses in the War of the Second Coalition, it was natural Austria would enter the war against France. \\n But there are other issues as well.  Francis of Austria was also Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor.  At the time, the HRE was a ceremonial title but nominally duty bound to defend the independence of the German states.  Bavaria, Hanover and Wuttenberg were major German states under French dominion and had to been removed from French yoke.  For centuries, it was French policy to maintain a divided Germany where a coalition of lesser German states could keep more powerful and independent German states in check from uniting. \\n And so Napoleon comes, utterly crushes the Austro-Russian army at Austerlitz and Emperor Francis, terrified that Napoleon may assume the crown of Holy Roman Emperor for himself, dissolves the ancient institution. \\n A year later, the Confederation of the Rhine is realized and Austria's armies are too badly defeated and desperately in needing of reform to challenge French domination of Central Europe.  Prussia-Russia and Great Britain form the Fourth Coalition to challenge France. \\n Except Prussia is just as needing in reforms as Austria and they are immediately defeated weeks into the war at Jena and the near entirety of its western armies are annihilated, captured or under siege.  The war immediately shifts East where Napoleon crushes the Russians at Friedland. \\n So now, Napoleon, undisputed leader of Central Europe, decides to revive Poland - an ancient state that was recently partitioned by Prussia-Austria and Russia.  Of course, the Coalition powers are especially against this as a Poland would take away their lands and anchor a French ally in the region.  Poland was also an important staging ground for Russian armies to the west and an important source of manpower and raw materials for Prussia.  So strategically speaking, it was a good move militarily but hard to sell diplomatically. \\n Then Napoleon, with the French navy destroyed at Trafalgar, decides the only realistic way to defeat the British was a total trade embargo attempts the Continental System - no trade with Britain.  Portugal, Britain's ancient ally, refuses and this leads to French armies invading.  Spain is seen as a weakening world power.  Without its navy (destroyed at Trafalgar) and its armies ineffective and badly needing of reform leading to Napoleon toppling the Spanish goverment to install his brother, Joseph, on the throne. \\n So Napoleon, not really believing the Spanish could pose that much resistance, commits hundreds of thousands of troops to occupy the region against Spanish guerrillas and the Duke of Wellington. \\n But Spain proves too difficult to bring down and this badly hurts France's reputation.  Austria, partly through the reforms, decides now is the time to strike and starts the War of the Fifth Coalition.  Austria is defeated and by marriage of an Austrian princess to Napoleon, cements a Austro-French alliance. \\n Russia continues to defy the Continental System, supplying crucial timber and hemp for British shipbuilding.  Napoleon decides to invade with a massive allied army. \\n And that's when winter happened. \\n So now Napoleon is without his armies and suddenly Prussia and Austria see their opportunity to strike back.  Austria and Prussia had both lost massive amounts of land at this point due to draconian peace settlements and were eager to retake them.  Napoleon is exiled to St. Elba and then gets called a coward a few times in the newspaper and decides to come back. \\n Then Waterloo happens. \\n And so all the European states decide, man, this Napoleon guy could really  **  up the delicate equilibrium of power in Europe.  So this Austrian Prime Minister, Metternich, comes along and tells everyone to lets place nice with each other and this was pretty cool for a few decades until France goes through another revolution  but meh, that's another story. \\n TL:DR - every country in Europe was like a high school drama queen. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('This is my favorite story about the Barnacle Goose, from Gerald of Wales: \\n \"There are here many birds that are called “Barnacles” [barnacoe] which in a wonderful way Nature unnaturally produces; they are like wild geese but smaller.

Generally, European swordsman did not categorise swords the way we do. \\n For example, Fiore dei Liberi, a 14th century master of arms, used the Italian word \"spada\" for his sword, which was a two-handed longsword, in his treatise on knightly martial arts. Hundreds of years later, 17th century master Ridolfo Capo Ferro used the same word \"spada\" to refer to a long, one-handed sword with a complex hilt designed mainly for the thrust - what we would probably call a \"rapier\". \\n To complicate matters even more, the 16th century German master Joachim Meyer used the word \"rappier\" to describe a one-handed cut-and-thrust sword, which would be called a \"sidesword\" by modern HEMA practitioners, based on the Italian term \"spade de lato\". But Italian masters that taught the use of this weapon, like Achille Marozzo and Giovanni dall\\'Aggochie simply call this weapon a \"spada\". \\n So how does this relate to the question at hand? Well, basically, there were certain swords, sometimes called \"military rapiers\" by modern people, which were used on the battlefield. If your definition of what a \"rapier\" is can accept those weapons (a bit more like cut-and-thrust swords and less like the thrust-optimised \"rapier\" we\\'re familiar with) as rapiers, then yes, rapiers have been deployed in more regimented battles. \\n So now we have established that for some definitions of \"rapier\", the weapon did appear on the battlefield. But how effective are they? Now here\\'s the kicker: throughout human history, swords were NOT primary weapons on the battlefield, outside of a few notable exceptions (like the Romans). From antiquity through the middle ages, spears were far more common. European knights? They used lances, pollaxes and other polearms. Japanese samurai? They started out as horse archers, and during the Sengoku period the spear was still the weapon of choice in a set-piece battle. Specifically, for the heyday of the rapier, the main battlefield weapons were the pike and early firearms. Personal sidearms like the rapier rarely enter into the equation at all! So was it ever used effectively? I would say no, in that the use of rapiers was never the deciding factor in the outcome of a battle. But then again, that statement can be applied to about 99% of all swords throughout human history, and while it might not have won or lost a battle, its use did control the life and death of certain individual soldiers on the battlefield, but accounts of those fights are rather harder to find. \\n TL;DR Depends on what you call a rapier. Some were used in battle, but swords never decided battles anyways. \\n Sources mentioned: \\n[Fiore dei Liberi,]( whose work on knightly combat included the use of wrestling, daggers, swords, spears, lances and other weapons. \\n [Ridolfo Capo Ferro,]( an Italian rapier master. \\n [Joachim Meyer,]( a German master who taught a whole bunch of different weapons. \\n [Achille Marozzo,]( a Bolognese master who published a very extensive treatise of arms. \\n [Giovanni dall\\'Agocchie,]( another Bolognese master. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Part of this will get into a debate over what the \"first universities\" were. As an Arabist I\\'m more sympathetic to the idea that institutions like the Nizamiyyas were a form of university than many European medievalists might be. At the very least, without getting into the definition of a \"university\" these madrassas were clearly a form of higher education. \\n In the Islamic world in the middle ages, who was eligible for higher education and what their benefits were were closely intertwined. While for much of the Middle Ages the political classes of the Islamic world consisted of either steppe peoples or slave soldiers, education offered a path for non-military figures to join the ranks of the elite by becoming members of the Ulema, the religious class of scholars within Islam. \\n Despite their clearest societal role being as religious leaders and scholars, because so much of late medieval history in the Islamic world the territories of Islamdom were dominated by external steppe peoples, the Ulema actually played a very powerful political role in mediating between the rulers and the ruled. Despite the constant flux of dynasties (Buyids, Ghaznavids, Seljuks, Ghurids, etc. etc.) because the Ulema were able to preserve the legal norms of Islam, they preserved a certain measure of societal continuity despite the total political chaos. \\n Access to this powerful political class was, at least theoretically, meritocratic, and even people from humble origins could rise to great heights as a religious scholar. Although of course the requisites of having access to education was inherently favorable to men from cities, and, of course, women had no role whatsoever. \\n This relationship between the foreign ruling class and the local intermediaries has been termed the Amir (Warrior Prince)/Ayan (Local Notable) system. \\n In terms of \"second jobs,\" I can\\'t speak to knowledge of any of scholars who took up such a job, but I can say that even a junior scholar\\'s preparation would have qualified them for other jobs. Entry to a madrasa would by definition and at a bare minimum have required the student to have memorized the Quran. Qualification as a religious judge would have further required memorization of a set number of hadiths and their respective Isnads (the chains of transmission from the Prophet to the recorder of the hadith) (depending on the time period, the number could reach the thousands.) Having memorized the Quran would allow such students to become Quran reciters, which was a paying position, as well as teachers of the Quran. Although being certified as a Qadi (religious judge) was a far more prestigious (and politically official) position than either of these. \\n So to give a bit of  TL:DR  for the Islamic world\\'s answer to your questions, in order: \\n Who was eligible? Everyone, but with a bias towards urban dwellers. \\n What were the benefits? Access to a powerful political class that was otherwise unavailable to non-military figures. \\n Would they have gained a higher salary than the alternative? Yes. \\n Major or specialization? The curriculum was by definition religious, but depending on the era in question there were different schools of law to choose from. \\n Second jobs? I don\\'t know of any scholars who describe having taken such jobs, but even entry-level students would have been qualified to perform a number of roles that were paid. \\n Sources: Marshall Hodgson\\'s  The Venture of Islam  goes into quite a lot of detail about how this political system worked in Islamdom in the Middle Ages with detail about social institutions including Madrasas. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"Well; err, this is awkward. Alas! I'm torn, because myths are what I  do  all day. Obviously, however, what you are asking for is if some old myths have had physical, tangible evidence found to back them up. Alas again, I'm in the History of Memory game, and that's the wrong field on so many levels for that kind of answer. But I do love myths. Would you be gracious and give me a moment of your time to digress? \\n Myths are weird and interesting things. Truly weird. And not what most folks reckon they are either. They're not actually the story you tell, see, or the memory you have of being told it – they're not even physical things. All of those things – the story, the items which are connected to that story – all that stuff is just the vehicle. Telling those stories and passing over significant objects is the process by which the myth leaps into your brain, snuffles around, and then makes itself at home. The myth is what happens in your brain when you hear that story or touch that item; it's all of the meaning thrown up by it; it's all the tropes that zing through your brain and make you happy, sad, angry, upset. The myth is actually being invoked in your brain by those stories, stories and objects which would otherwise be boring, or incomprehensible. It is like a “charge” which makes the story worth hearing, and gives it meaning. \\n Are you with me so far? Good, good. (That's a tricky concept that one; look at Richard Slotkin's “Regeneration Through Violence” for a waaaay better explanation.) Right; onto phase two. \\n That charge is what Jim Fernandez calls a “Richness of Understanding”. So lets back up a little and think about what a word is. A word is a metaphor, right? A French dude named Derrida reckoned most nouns had been metaphors once, but the meaning had kind of worn through. Think of when you say a single word over and over again until it loses all meaning. Metaphors do the same thing; like the word “muscle”. Not a metaphor, right? Errr, well, actually - “Muscle” comes from the German word for 'mouse'. Apparently the movement of muscles under the skin reminded German folk of small critters moving under the skin. But that's gone, right? We don't think of muscles as little creatures any more.  But we do think of things moving under the skin when we think of muscles.  The original meaning has worn off, but the connotations of that original metaphor still remain, just kinda hidden from us. Not concious, but there. Effectively, because words have bucket-loads of connotations and connections between them just like this, when a story is told a veritable shit-tonne of meanings go crashing through our minds. The sheer quantity of this understanding has to be controlled by the artefact – the story, or the object - or else we'd never get the same myth in two different people's minds. People would always interpret the tropes and meanings into completely different myths. \\n Awesome: if you've gotten through that wall of text, I high five you. \\n So myths are the charge attached to stories, and that charge is super bloody dense.  The story's job is to control that understanding; get it roughly the same in everyone's minds. Reproduce it, in other words. Why? Well: that is... probably more likely to get me booed. My personal opinion? Because it tells people within those societies about themselves. It is a way of showing people what abstract concepts like “virtue” are, how the world works, and where their place in it is. That's why thoroughly different cultures have  intensely  different myths, sometimes quite hard to understand. [The legend of Eklavya from the Mahabharata, for instance, the attempted message of which I find most Americans are either confused by, or rebel at.]( \\n That's why lots of stories actually invoke the same myth, and the same tropes turn up over and over, by the way - old myths change to suit new needs. The myth which the Wild West stories invoke, for instance, is pretty damn close to the myth which the story of the Priest/Murderer/King invokes (- that latter one is one of the oldest stories in the Western Canon. For a better analysis of the connection, see  Regeneration Through Violence  by Richard Slotkin.) \\n Anyway, the point of this was that myths are always real. They wouldn't keep reproducing themselves if they weren't. The only reason people need physical proof is because they want to make that charge richer, more supported with the objects and artefacts. We'd slot those things into the existing framework of meaning, see? And even if we said “no – not in this story, perhaps in this one” we still use it to invoke. \\n TL:DR derp derp derp Levi-Strauss. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('Right, let\\'s do this chronologically. It\\'s late here so I\\'ll write more if people ask. \\n The Eastern Front was a goddamn mess. The first thing that people seem to glance over is that the Schlieffen Plan\\'s calculation of a six-week Russian mobilization period was founded in a bunch of tangible contemporary evidence, so nobody expected the opening moves to go as they did. When the Russian Army pitched itself headlong into the fight within two weeks of the first shots being fired and declarations of war being issued, the German government  panicked . Because only the Eighth Army (roundabout 150,000 men in strength, all told) remained to defend that entire side of Germany, you can imagine the consternation when the Russians defied all odds and logic to field half a million men over a month ahead of schedule and aimed directly at the heart of Prussia (the largest and central component of the Second Reich). Engagements outside the towns of Stalluponen and Gumbinnen exposed critical weaknesses in the force structure of both sides, especially between the commanding officers - General von Francois had a nasty habit of doing whatever the hell he wanted to, and General Prittwitz tended to waffle or seize up at important junctures. But the Russians made serious strategic errors in dividing their two armies whilst advancing through East Prussia, and the new German generals on the scene - two men named Ludendorff and Hindenburg who would, by 1916, effectively run Germany - managed to isolated and defeat the Russian Second Army at the Battle of Tannenberg while the First Army dithered, capturing over 100,000 men in the process. Following a few more skirmishes around Masurian Lakes (slightly east of Tannenberg) the Russians were thrown out of Germany for the rest of the war. \\n On the other hand, the Austro-Hungarians were pretty much the textbook definition of hapless. Though the Russians had invaded their land without rifles or ammo or food or trains, the Austrians still took a quarter of a million casualties in the opening month of the war and lost the land they were defending anyway. The province of Galicia (mostly located in modern Ukraine) was held by the Russians until 1915, when a combined Austro-German offensive took it back.  That  occupation lasted only until 1916, when the Russians pushed back in the Brusilov Offensive, which introduced many of the modern concepts of fast-moving modern attack strategy. On the other hand, that particular action, though one of the largest territorial gains of the entire war, inflicted something in the ballpark of  2.5 million casualties , a loss from which the Austro-Hungarians never recovered. I would also argue that it seriously crippled the Russian military, but for assorted domestic reasons it\\'s probably safe to say that the average Russian civilian didn\\'t know/care about exact developments on the front. Anyway, for our purposes let\\'s just say that because the average Russian soldier was suffering both serious disillusionment with the Tsarist government and with the war itself, by 1916 the collapse within the Russian military began. \\n (For the record, I am aware I am glancing over the war with Serbia and the Rumanian intervention and other such events, but for the sake of expediency and my own immediate laziness we will bunch those together into the \"Southern Front\" category and deal with them elsewhere.) \\n As you have probably gathered by now, the war on the Eastern Front tended to move a lot more than that of the West. Offensives across Eastern and Central Europe might gain 50 to 100 miles at a time, albeit not without enormous costs. Trenches were used but not as frequently nor comprehensively as those in France, though I would argue that artillery became that much more important to commanders engaged in the East. Actual attempts to dislodge the enemy were fairly infrequent, as only Germany amongst the major three combatants had any kind of infrastructure leading to the East capable of quickly transporting and mobilizing large forces. \\n In regards to how Germany fared against the Russians, I would say that they held their own. This isn\\'t some sort of backhanded slight: few nations have  ever  managed to hold against the Russian steamroller for long, especially when it\\'s pointed at Europe. So from that perspective I would say that Germany did an excellent job of keeping the ball in their court for a large section of time, in holding back an ostensibly unstoppable enemy according to pre-war thinking (with some considerable help from the Austrian meatshield), though, as always, exact credit division is difficult between two allies who shared the burden like Austria-Hungary and Germany. I am personally inclined to say that Germany knew what it was doing and contributed a lot more to the effort than their ally, but then again there are also decades of post-war books and writings coming from Germans extolling their own country and ripping on the Dual Monarchy. Austria-Hungary didn\\'t even exist after 1918, making it kind of difficult for them to produce any counterpointed works extolling themselves and exposing Germany\\'s fault. But all in all, if history is truly written by the victors, it\\'s not a coincidence that German works and documents form the majority of our modern knowledge of the Eastern Front in World War I. \\n tl;dr: More mobile than the Western Front and incurring metric fucktons of casualties all the same. \\n',\n  0),\n ('For a great explanation of the turbans in the Indian Army you should check out [Bernard Cohn]( He argues that \\nthe turban is an effective example of the cultural complexities of the British Empire in India.

In that war, not only had the Germans occupied large swaths of northern France and the coal and iron mines and related metal industry (vital to the war effort), the defensive had proven much stronger than the offensive due to the ease of moving reinforcements by rail to any threatened part of the front, while the attacked had to move by foot and horse through the former front line to exploit a breakthrough. \\n The German had built the Siegfried line along the border, a decent set of fortifications and defensive structures, which the French, with experience from ww1, thought too expensive to try to force their way through. \\n The French plan 1939 was as follows; \\n \\n The Poles are to resist as long as possible. If they are succesful, the French army will launch an offensive against the Germans 14 days after the declaration of war. If not, the Poles are to retreat to the southeastern part of the country and will be supplied by the French through Romania, which was friendly towards both countries. Like the Serbian army and the Salonika bridgehead in ww1, the Polish army will keep being a threat to the Germans, and will be ready to break out once the main German force has been destroyed. \\n \\n France and Britain was negotiating with the Soviets right up to the start of the war for an alliance. Stalin strung them along and kept demanding their support for demands on Poland and Romania, which the allies did not want to grant. In reality, they had already signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact with its secret protocols. The Poles were in the process of retreating what was left of their army to the Romanian brigdehead when the Soviets declared war and invaded on the 17th of September 1939. This cut the Poles off from the intended bridgehead. Combined with the devastating defeat of the Bzura counterattack and the destruction in that battle of the Poznan and Pomorze armies, the Poles were pretty much done. The French then cancelled their probing attack into the Saar region and their intended offensive, as it would do them no good. They then revised their plan. \\n \\n \\n As opposed to the common misconception, the French did not rely on the Maginot line, nor did it cost them that much. The basic idea of the Maginot line was to dissuade the Germans from attacking Alsace-Lorraine and instead funneling them through Belgium - a job it did quite well. The intention was also to save manpower, as France had only about half the population of Germany - far fewer men was needed to man the fortifications than would be needed to man the border as regular infantry units. The whole line cost about 5 billion francs 1930-1939 - about 2% of the French military budget at that time. \\n As Poland fell, the French revised their plans. Now, they wanted to fight in Belgium. There's several reasons for them waiting. Attacking the Siegfried line on their own (the British BEF was nowhere near ready in Autumn 1939) without the Germans distracted by the Poles or the Soviets seemed folly. Belgium had withdrawn from the allies in 1934 to declare itself neutral, and the French wanted to have the Belgian 650 000 man on its side rather than the opposite - it meant waiting on the Germans to attack Belgium. Also, by Summer 1940, the British would have their BEF fully ready, including an armoured division. \\n So the French dug in, preparing for a long war where resources and industry would count. They ramped up tank production, ensured their supply lines to their colonies and set their society up for war production. \\n The new plan was; \\n \\n Wait until the British have their army in order before doing anything offensive. The Royal Navy will strangle the Germans out of vital supplies, such as food, tungsten (needed for metalworking), chrome (needed for armour), copper and oil. Trying to get Sweden to stop exporting iron ore and Finland to stop exporting nickel was also on the table. The whole affair in Norway and the threats of an expeditionary force to help Finland was more about strangling those exports to Germany than any other issue. The Germans simply got to Norway first. The Germans had been re-arming at neckbreaking speed (and were close to bankrupcy several times, only bailed out by seizing the Austrian and Czechoslovak gold reserves and foreign assets) and the French were only beginning to catch up when the war started. \\n \\n If the Germans attack, it will be through Belgium. The best of the French army will then rush north together with the BEF and link up with the Belgian army. Together they will grind down the German offensive on Belgian soil, either through vicious attrition or a decisive battle. This keeps northern France, with a lot of population and industry, not even mentioning coal and iron mines, safe and free from occupation. Once the best parts of the German army have been destroyed in Belgium, the French will lead the offensive from Belgium that will flank the Siegfried line and punch into Germany's vital Ruhr industrial and coal producing area. After defeating the German army there, France would have crippled the German ability to conduct war and thus won, with minimal casualties and devastation to France itself. \\n \\n \\n The French were reinforced in their belief that their plans were correct in the [Mechelen incident]( in which a German liason plane carrying the full plan for the invasion of France crashed in Belgium on the 10th of January 1940. The event caused the Germans to scrap their plan and go with von Manstein's daring attack through the Ardennes instead. \\n The French considered the Ardennes impassable for large mechanised forces - their cavalry was screening the forest (5 divisions and 3 colonial cavalry brigades, however, most of their attention was to the north, towards the Belgian part of the forest) with a force of infantry behind them at Sedan (2 infantry divisions). The Germans managed, despite massive traffic jams, to get a force of 3 Panzer divisions with 771 tanks through. They brushed the cavalry aside and crashed through the French infantry. The rest is history. \\n The French prepared for a long war - they were right in that, it is just that it turned out to not be very long for them. For example, the French limited their air force to 1-2 combat missions per day, intending to keep them fresh and ready for continued combat for a long time, while the Germans managed to get 4-6 combat missions per plane and day, resulting in much more effective combat usage, but crews exhausted and prone to mistakes and accidents reducing their strength. By June, the Luftwaffe was almost completely worn out and needed more than a month of rest and refit before they could launch the Battle of Britain. The French also retreated parts of their airforce out of range of German fighters in order to protect them from attacks on their airfields, to allow them to rest and repair planes in peace - which meant that a large part of the French air force was in the process of moving bases and unavailable at the decisive moment. \\n TL;DR  The French prepared to fight in Belgium to protect France and because they thought they needed the Belgians and British to counter German manpower superiority. They also prepared for a long war and believed the defensive was stronger than the offensive. \\n Edit: Spelling, link. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('Q: How did feudalism and peerage work? \\nA: Erratically depending on the individuals involved. \\n Grand duchies were, in general, officially ( de jure ) part of larger political units such as the Holy Roman Empire or succeeding Austro-Hungarian Empire.  HOWEVER  grand dukes would often act independently of their lords, due to the fact that the feudal system was based on the relationship between liege and vassal. So if Grand Duke A hates his lord Emperor B, he might align himself with King C instead of his official lord (B) any dispute between B & C. \\n Independent political units (kingdom/empires) were generally divided into smaller individual units (duchies, earldoms, counties, viscounties, marquisates, bishoprics, etc. depending on location) which were controlled through webs of family alliances and intrigue (The Earl of X may be a cousin of Duke Y and Count Z, and therefore allies with them) or united in one person through political marriages (I am both the Duke of Y and the Count of Z). Remaining pieces of land not distributed to vassals were administered directly by the lord responsible for that area. Example: the Duke is in charge of Y duchy, which is divided into 4 parts: the earldom of X, the county of Z, the bishopric of V and an unorganized portion that reports directly to Duke Y. The earldom of X, under Duke Y, has 3 portions: the lands of monastery R, the county of S, and the remaining portion directly report to Earl X. For example of what this looks like, check out this [map of France during the Feudal Era]( \\n Different lords had different levels of authority over other lords depending on what part of the Feudal Era it was, what the laws of the realm were and also what the political/military situation was. Generally only the highest political figure (king or emperor) could create or destroy noble titles. According to most laws, being a vassal of someone required an obligation to serve them in some way: mainly either through rent (payment) or service in war or by supplying labor (Tuchman, B, A Distant Mirror, pg. 6 & 16). However, while the King could legally demand that Duke Y or Count Z provide him with a certain yearly income, often times vassals would stall or refuse to provide what they were legally required. \\n TL;DR - Feudalism was a hierarchical structure that organized political structures based on relationships between liege and vassal. Legally, vassals were required to provide money or services to their liege, but that was often ignored due to the complicated political landscape of the feudal era. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Larger than 500,000 sq km?  According to  Wikipedia . \\n How you treat colonies matters a lot.  Iceland has had a continuous government and culture since settlement with no border changes- but it was a province of Denmark for most of its existence as well (and is quite small).   Considering European colonial powers, Portugal probably has had the same borders for the longest period of time (if you don\\'t consider the gain and loss of their colonial empire).  However, they are quite small. \\n For countries larger than 500,000 sq km (or close to it), Spain has had its border relatively unchanged since 1492, if you don\\'t consider their colonial empire. \\n If it does, though, we can eliminate most of the world.  South America changed drastically relatively recently, with the Viceroyalties and administrative audencias having very different borders (greater than 10%) difference from the modern countries.  Africa was completely redrawn, and many areas lacked the governmental structure to be considered a nation state until relatively recently. \\n Most of the Middle East, South and Southeast Asia was colonised, ending their chances.  Iran (Persia) lost a great deal of territory to both Russia and England in the 19th century as part of the Great Game, ending their contention. \\n China would have taken the cake- the only major permanent change to Chinese territory since the Qing dynasty was the loss of Mongolia.  Mongolia has an area of 1,500,000 sq km; China has 9.5 million.  This would give the Qing Dynasty an area of approximately 11 million sq km; Mongolia was slightly more than 10% of that total (if you made it 15%, than China would be your likely answer). \\n But looking back the 55 potential candidates, all of the major countries with long, contiguous histories have undergone major territorial gains or losses- the US, Soviet Union/Russia, and China, as mentioned above.  France and Spain are disqualified by the colonial empire; nearly every other country on that list has been colonized, with the exception of Thailand, which still gave up a ton of its former territory, disqualifying it. \\n This actually means that  every  state larger than 500,000 sq km has undergone massive territorial gains or losses since the start of the 19th century, if you include gaining or losing colonies as shifting borders (or being a colony- Greenland would be our clear winner otherwise). \\n So, we can go back and look at dates of independence for colonies, many of which have had stable borders since becoming independent.  Many South American countries declared independence in 1821 and gained functional independence shortly after.  Some territory changed hands since then, but far less than 10%.  Here my guess for the best contender (I am not an expert on South American history) would be Chile or Argentina.  Both declared independence early, but you can date them at different times, and officially achieved independence around 1817-1818.  Other South American nations went large territorial shifts since then (the dissolution of Gran Colombia, Bolivia\\'s territorial losses).  However, while I haven\\'t done the math, both Chile and Argentina are large enough that these changes would not have been 10% of more of their territory. \\n If 1817-1818 is our benchmark, looking down the list of 55 candidate countries,  and eliminating those that had empires or lose them after that point, I cannot find any that jump out as having maintained territorial integrity.  African countries were rarely such before the Europeans came; the few large political entities that did exist were largely destroyed.  Ethiopia was only reunified in 1855, so it\\'s out of the running.  The rest were either colonizers or colonized; Russia became the USSR and broke up, China lost Mongolia, and that covers almost the entire list. \\n TL;DR    For countries greater than 500,000 sq km, if you don\\'t include the gain and loss of colonies, Spain probably wins at 1492.  France has been [\"relatively\" stable]( If you do, Argentina and Chile at 1817-1818 are the best answer I can find, by process of elimination.  If you allow for larger fluctuations, China might win, unless you consider the temporary independence of Tibet a territorial loss. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"Point of fact: 5 November was  not  the date of execution.

Even if Eisenhower had more control than he did, McCarthy could still reasonably claim protection on first amendment grounds. There is very little that he could do.

Diplomacy between the two blocs collapsed, the diplomats on all sides tried to retreat from war while mobilising their armies in case shit kicked off. Because Russia mobilised, it meant Germany who's strategy (the schliefden plan) relied on hitting France and Russia pre-emptively at the same time on a very tight schedule, had to enact its plan and invade Belgium to bypass French defensed (bringing Britain into the war), and declare war on Russia and France. Horror ensues.\\n  In terms if background, WW1 was the product of about 20-30 years of European tension. Prior to 1900, The unification of Germany in 1871 changed the entire situation in Europe. France, for the first time in generations shared a border with a non-allied major European power. Britain faced a substantial economic and naval threat when the technological revolution kicked off in Germany. And crucially, Austria-Hungary (having lost its possesions to Germany in Western Europe) and Russia only had the Balkans to expand their influence imperially.\\n Germany's position in this while under Bismarck was designed to prevent war. Alliances with both Austria and Russia was intended to prevent war between the two over the Balkans and prevent tension bubbling over with Britain and France as they still had each other to compete with. However, this gradually collapsed under Wilhelm ii coming to power in Germany. He ended the alliance with Russia, and failed to work with Bismark leading to his resignation which was a massive blow to Germany diplomatically. Moreover, after 1900 Germany began to rapidly expand its Navy, presenting it in nationalistic tones and as a method of achieveing empire, best represented by Von Bulow's 'place in the sun speech'. This led to a naval arms race with Britain from around 1900 onwards, ramping tension up massively and leading to Germany feeling surrounded by the three most powerful nations on earth, with only Austria-Hungary to help them. \\n      The arms race also fed into growing tension between France and Germany. The fear of being surrounded/ wanting to gain an empire (depends on the view you take) led Germany to build up its military and to try to weaken French and British imperial expansion. Most notably in Morrocco (wikipedia the 2nd morrocco crisis).\\n  Simultaneously Russia and Austria-Hungary clash over influence in the Balkan states. Russia made an alliance with Serbia, while Austria opposed Serbia aggressively. Germany, feeling unable to break for the alliance with Austria because doing so would have left them completely without powerful allies in the event of war, was forced to go support Austria as relations got progressively worse with Russia.

(Knight, 119) Its causes were myriad, but rooted in the export of Opium to China, one of the few valuable goods the west had to offer the Oriental Empire, and the banning of said drug by the Chinese government, ostensibly because of the moral degradation caused by its use, but more likely due to the economic instability caused by the outpouring of silver into the pockets of foreign merchants. (Hernon, 301) British merchants were confined at Lintin for refusing to surrender their stocks of Opium, and, when the drugs were finally surrendered (after much persuasion by British diplomat Charles Elliot) the Chinese Authorities destroyed them, amounting to a loss of 3,000,000 pounds of raw opium. \\n After a series of small-scale naval conflicts, war was finally declared in 1840, and an expeditionary force dispatched from Singapore to Canton, consisting of 16 warships armed with 540 guns, 4 armed and iron-plated steamers, and 28 transports carrying 4,000 soldiers, including British infantry, marines, and Indian sepoys. (Hernon, 311) \\n The engagements of the war largely consisted of amphibious assaults against imposing fortifications, breached with ladders or on the shoulders of fellow soldiers, as the 18th Royal Irish did when assaulting Amoy. (Murray, 13) In these battles Chinese troops were outclassed by the superior discipline and weaponry of their British adversaries. \\n The standard firearm used by British troops in this war was the percussion musket, measuring 4 ft. 7 in. and weighing ten pounds. It was accurate to around 100 yards.  An experienced soldier could fire off roughly three rounds a minute, but soldiers were taught to fire on command. While the percussion musket featured a rudimentary sight, making aiming somewhat possible, the strength in the weapon lay in mass formations of infantry firing in volleys. (Knight, 155) The accounts of the war by Alexander Murray and John Ouchterlony are filled with examples of the superiority of the Percussion-Cap musket when fired en masse. Ouchterlony describes an incident at Sanyuanli, where Royal Marines fired ‘A destructive volley, poured into the crowded ranks of the Chinese, at the distance of a few paces, speedily swept away the astonished pursuers and taught our own people… the value of… the percussion muskets.’ (Ouchterlony, 156) \\n When soldiers engaged the enemy at close quarters, they were expected to fix bayonets. This 7-inch blade was attached to a socket the slotted over the muzzle of the musket.  (Knight, 160) This method of attachment sometimes proved ineffective, as seen in an incident during the Battle of Ningpo described by Lieutenant Alexander Murray, when a ‘White-Button Mandarin’ wrenched the bayonet off a soldiers firelock. (Murray, 106) Indeed, soldiers preferred using the butt end of their muskets in close quarters-combat rather than the ineffective blades. (Murray, 188) \\n The Chinese Army, which opposed the British, numbered roughly 1,000,000 men, the core of which were eight divisions of Manchu Tartars, mainly cavalry, known as ‘Bannermen’, armed largely with obsolete matchlocks and bows. Most ordinary infantry carried spears, poleaxes and swords, some still equipped with chainmail armor.  (Hernon, 311) \\n Appearances on both sides were designed to intimidate: Chinese troops utilized tumblers and acrobats, dressed in fantastic costumes, to frighten their enemies (Myerly, 86), whereas British troops wore bright red jackets, tall shakos and white cross belts, with gleaming cap and breastplates. Ouchterlony described the troops preparing to assault Amoy: ‘Their colours gaily floating… equipped and accoutered with all the smartness of a Hyde Park field-day’ (Ouchterlony, 355). \\n The disparity between the losses of the two forces is extraordinary: At the battle of Chapu in 1842, the British lost 9 dead and 55 wounded compared to over 1,200 Chinese killed; at Tsekee, British troops lost three dead and 20 wounded to a Chinese loss of between 400-900 men. Disciplined volleys of British Musketry felled hundreds of Chinese soldiers armed with bows, spears, and swords. (Knight, 119) \\n The difference in casualties was in no way due to lack of Chinese courage. At the battle of Chapu, 300 Tartar soldiers made a ‘last stand’ in a joss-house (a type of shrine for the worship of indigenous Chinese deities), and fought until the building burned around them. 53 were taken prisoner, all wounded. One elderly officer refused to surrender, despite promises of good treatment, and was skewered by British bayonets. (Hernon, 328) Vicious street fighting occurred at Jinjiang, where bannermen fought bitterly for every house and alley in the city. (Hernon, 329) \\n Those who did not succumb to bullets or bayonets often committed suicide. Lieutenant Alexander Murray of the Royal Irish saved a Chinese soldier, only to have said soldier cut his own throat. Such incidents were far from uncommon. At Chapu, and elsewhere, British troops fought through the city to find that many of the defenders had killed themselves, their wives and their children. An English officer saw houses holding as many as ‘8 to 10 dead bodies’. He further went on to describe women and children drowning themselves in a small pond the day after the city’s capture. (Hernon, 328) \\n Incompetent generalship had just as much to do with the Chinese defeat as did British firepower. Local commanders spent more time trying to root out traitors among their armies and the civilian populace rather than prepare their defenses against British attacks. At an even higher level, officials such as Imperial Commissioner Lin Zexu outright lied to Emperor, spinning fabulous tales of crushing British defeats in order to preserve their favor in the Imperial court. Even in the field, Chinese forces succumbed to mismanagement by their superiors. A force besieging British-held Chenhai might have succeeded had its reserves been sent in, but, ironically, the reserve commander was incapacitated in a palanquin, smoking opium. (Hernon, 326) \\n By far the greatest killer of British troops was disease. After the capture of Chusan in 1840, British troops camped in a malarial swamp on the outskirts of the city. Lacking fresh food (most of their rations had been brought all the way from India), over 1/3 of the troops were rendered unfit for duty; within a month, twelve or more coffins a day were needed to cope with the death toll. By the end of the year, 450 out of the 3,000-strong garrison were dead, more than were killed in any battle during the war. (Hernon, 314) \\n The First Opium War ended with the Treaty of Nanking, signed aboard the  HMS Cornwallis  on August 29, 1842. The Chinese ports of Canton, Amoy, Foochow, Ningpo, and Shanghai would be open to foreign trade, and British consuls would be stationed in each; the Chinese government would pay an indemnity of 21 million silver dollars; diplomatic relations would be conducted on equal terms; and the Hong monopoly, which controlled trade in Canton, would be abolished . Additionally, Britain would take control of Hong Kong, derided by then-Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston as ‘a barren island with barely a house upon it’. Said ‘barren island’ would later, with an influx of merchants and the investment of the British government, become one of the world’s most prosperous ports. \\n While having one a total victory over the Chinese, Britain’s prestige was ultimately wounded by the conflict. Her actions against the Chinese were seen as one-sided bullying due to the superior strength of British arms, and many were dismayed to see the might of the empire rallied in support of drug trafficking.

This is an essential part of our training and work as professional historians. If you undertake your PhD in history at a North American institution, for example, you will spend the first  year  of your program reading all the major works in three fields relevant to your topic, and this year concludes with your comprehensive examinations.* In my department, this equals out to 120-130 books and/or an equivalent number of articles whose arguments you are expected to know inside and out. \\n As you begin reading you will find that not all work in your field is created equal; there are some monographs out there that you think are better, some that are worse, (some that are terrible), some that leave wide holes in their arguments whether by neglect, inadequate research or unaccessible source material, or because those holes haven't been filled by other historians yet (etc). Furthermore, some historians respond to the arguments that others have presented--sometimes a debate takes place that goes on over a period of years or decades; some books inspire and/or directly influence subsequent research and monographs. Some schools of thought see their popularity rise as explanatory devices, and then see that popularity fall as something else comes along that is seen as a better or more satisfactory explanatory device in our work of making sense of and interpreting the past. Sometimes these schools of thought compete with and inspire each other. \\n The reason we undergo the process of comprehensive exams (or whatever system of learning the literature is used in a given school or in the process of self-training) is so that we become  intimately  acquainted with the range of work in our chosen fields. This allows us to, first, understand our fields better and, second, to weigh which arguments/schools of thought/theories we find most compelling or best suited to explain phenomenon X, and which ones we might wish to discard, challenge, or push further.

But he didn\\'t want the Japanese to know. So over the course of several months he moved a huge force to the East along the Siberian Railroad. \\n At the same time, Japan was trying to reach out with \"peace feelers\" to the Soviets, trying to convince them mediate for conditional surrender with the US and the UK. Stalin thought this was highly amusing and had no intention of giving them any assistance, but slowly strung them out. The Japanese pinned quite a lot of their hopes on the USSR not entering the war at the very least, and helping them at the very best, but the Soviets had other plans. \\n The Soviets agreed at Yalta to declare war within 90 days of the defeat of Germany. In return, they\\'d get a bunch of territory back that had been taken by Japan after the Russo-Japanese war, and also get some extra islands that would give them much better access to the Pacific. They wanted to enter at sort of a perfect moment — in order to get the eastern concessions they had been promised at Yalta, they had to enter the war before Japan surrendered, but at the same time, they wanted their victory to be very swift and decisive, and that meant drawing things out for an even-more weakened Japan. \\n Potsdam ended on on August 2nd and Stalin headed back to Moscow. The Soviet declaration of war was more or less was imminent, planned for around August 11-12.

You can find a much more elaborate story in Karma Phuntsho\\'s  The History of Bhutan  and/or in Omair Ahmad\\'s  The Kingdom at the Centre of the World. \\n In 1616, Lomon (the western half of what would later become known as Bhutan) was a culturally distinct area of what was otherwise Greater Tibet, probably understood at the time as \"Tibet,\" though we should bear in mind that there was no greater Tibetan identity at the time. Most people identified with either their own village or - if they were a religious official - their school of Vajrayana Buddhism. It\\'s not in the scope of this question to go into the intricacies of Vajrayana history, so I\\'ll keep it brief. The Kagyupa were in control of Tibet after the Sakyapas fell out of favor after their Mongol patronage ended, and the Gelukpas came into power in the latter half of the 1500s. It\\'s my own historical theory that there was a mass exodus of Kagyupas from the northern side of the Himalayas (more or less what we call \"Tibet\" today) to the southern side, into today\\'s Nepal (historical Mustang), India (today\\'s Ladakh), and Bhutan. One of the most famous exiles was a man named Ngawang Namgyal, called by his followers \"the Zhabdrung\" which literally means \"At Whose Feet One Submits.\" \\n Anyway, he moved south partly for family connections, and partly because Lomon was flush with Kagyupas of the Drukpa school (Vajryana is a subsect of Buddhism, Kagyu is a subsect of Vajrayana, and Drukpa is a subsect of Kagyu; -pa is a suffix indicating a person, Bodpa is Tibetan, Drukpa is literally \"Dragoner\" and in historical context refers to the religion, but in modern context refers to a Bhutanese person in Dzongkha... ANYWAY) the Zhabdrung crossed the Himalayas to Bhutan where he separated it from the influence of the Dalai Lamas and the Ganden Phodrang, the ruling government of Lhasa valley, and soon all (most) of Tibet. Tibet and their Mongol allies ended up invading Bhutan seven times, and were successful only in 1730, but Bhutan by then was intensely separate and Tibet only levied a small reparation and made no claims at control over the southern valleys. \\n Tibet was more or less independent in the early half of the 18th Century, but in the 1770s, more drama occurred, this time with the Brahmanist Nepalis out of Katmandu who used a small religious dispute to justify their attempted plundering of Lhasa. The Tibetans held them off in a vicious war, but ultimately asked Qing Dynasty China for help in the war. The Nepalis were beaten off in the war, but the Qing were around to stay. The requirement for their assistance was that two Manchu Ambans were to be placed in Lhasa making Tibet a vassal subject of the Qing. Since Bhutan had separated and largely made their peace with Tibet by that time, Bhutan did not fall under Qing dominion. It\\'s also interesting to note that this was about the time that both Tibet and Bhutan acquired their English names - up until 1776 they were used interchangeably, with some maps showing Bhutan as stretching all the way from the Ganges to Siberia - by the Scotsman George Bogle who distinguished them in a letter he wrote calling the southern one \"Bhutan\" and the northern one \"Tibet.\" \\n This is a convenient segue into the next chapter of the story: Britain. She was in the middle of two imperial projects, one being India, and one being China. The main goal here was to monopolize global tea production, largely through trade with China until she found out that tea also can grow quite well in the foothills of the Himalayas. So aside from taking everything they could, the British also decided to take all those places as well. In a double whammy, Britain conquered and annexed Assam, and then forced a decidedly unfair treaty on Sikkim, thereby surrounding Bhutan on its southern and western fronts. Bhutan was decidedly uninterested in Tibet\\'s solution of Manchu protection (who were in no position to help, regardless) and wanted to avoid the fate of Sikkim, but were left with limited options. For many years, Britain tried to avoid military intervention to their problem with Bhutan because they feared there was some Chinese involvement in Bhutan (there wasn\\'t) but without any definitive proof that there wasn\\'t, the Brits played it safe. \\n That is until the Opium Wars. The British, after a lot of blood, eventually learned that there was no Chinese/Manchu connection in Bhutan, and it was fair game. They sent the architect of the Sikkim plan, Sir Ashley Eden, to Bhutan to sign a deal with the most powerful man in Bhutan, Jigme Namgyal (father of the future First King of Bhutan, Sir Ugyen Wangchuck). The Black Regent turned Ashley away in a humiliating episode that directly led to the Duar War. The British easily invaded Bhutan, but had a hard time actually getting out. It was hard to enjoy what they thought was a victory with Bhutanese arrows constantly getting dropped in their tea. In 1864, they signed the Treaty of Sinchula which granted the British the \"Duars\" (the area being fought over in the first place) as part of Assam, while the Bhutanese promised to not raid into the area in exchange for some annual monies. It also incorporated Bhutan as an advisory member of the British Empire, but  not  a member of the Raj. This is the legal basis for why Sikkim became an Indian state, and for why Bhutan remained an independent nation. \\n Fast forward to post-World War II. India has just become independent. Sikkim was a protectorate of India, but couldn\\'t become a state. In the Indian constitution, all Indian states had to have democratic governments and Sikkim was still ruled by the Chogyal (King). After a horrifying episode concerning Nepali militias, voter fraud, and intervention by the Indian army, Sikkim became annexed into India, was a state, and is now majority-Hindu, majority-Nepali, and has lost many traces of its past Tibetan identity. Bhutan, no matter how many Nepalis enter its borders, is still legally its own entity and is not subject to military intervention by Delhi (at least not on this issue...). Indeed, Bhutan\\'s own constitution up to the 21st Century, actually had no democratic requirements. \\n On the other side of the border, China invaded Tibet (despite their own claims to the contrary). Their invasion, just like the Manchu overlordship of Tibet, did not extend to Bhutan because Bhutan was its own country. My guess is that China knew that both the British, Tibetans, and Mongols had a tough time fighting and ruling in Bhutan (though for different reasons) so it was probably not in the cards at the time. However, with the threat of Chinese invasion, Bhutan entered a series of military alliances with India. There are many Indian army bases all around Bhutan, today. Most of them in strategic locations especially in Haa and Bumthang (classic routes of northerly invasion). I believe there is also one in Tashigang which was actually put to use during the Sino-Indian War in 1962. Today the border between Bhutan and Chinese-controlled-Tibet is officially closed, but still open to tribes of nomadic herders who (AFAIK) posses special documents granting them access to both the Chinese and Bhutanese side of the border. \\n Bhutan\\'s relationship with India is usually referred to as the \"Road of Friendship.\" The relationship is very heavily sided in favor of India owing to the latter\\'s size and relative influence. And while they treat Bhutan quite well, offering her all the formalities and amenities of any foreign country, Bhutan has been trying to stem Indian influence (and risks of being a legitimate client state) by reaching out to China, albeit carefully. \\n These efforts at reaching out usually involve trying to solve their continuing border dispute. But it\\'s also a cultural definition problem. The Bhutanese know that there\\'s a long history of Tibetan relationships, but are still love-hate with their northern relations. All Bhutanese I know have visiting Lhasa on their bucket list, and will regularly regard the Dalai Lama as an incarnation of Chenrizi and pay him the respect of any other Rinpoche, but will usually consider their relationship to Tibet to be entirely historical and nothing more. I guess it\\'s like the Spanish recognizing Rome\\'s influence, but being remiss to compare themselves to Italians in any way, despite the fact that Italian and Spanish are practically mutually intelligible (and I say that based on first hand experience listening to a Spaniard and an Italian converse in their own respective languages... to each other. At the same time). \\n If you know anything about Chinese claims to Tibet, you\\'ll know that China claims Tibetans are a \"sub-race\" or \"minority nationality\" or some other fabrication that basically says \"Tibetans are Chinese so deal with it.\" Recently (and I forget the actual incident, though I believe it is in Omair Ahmad\\'s book) the Chinese forced the Bhutanese to question their own history, which would lend further credence to Chinese claims of overlordship over all things pan-Tibetan (including Bhutan), or suddenly force Bhutan\\'s 60-year hug with India into uncomfortable levels. \\n TL;dr, Bhutan avoided annexation into British India by playing hard to get diplomatically and militarily, by independent India through grandfathering treaties, and by Communist China through cozying up to India and more treaties. And all the time through geography and difficult terrain which was too hot and humid for Tibetans and Mongols, but too rough and unknown for the British. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"Strictly speaking, your first part is a what-if, so not really within the realm of /r/AskHistorians to answer, but I'll give it a shot and say no.

It is unlikely that he would have either become PM in the (extremely unlikely) event of a British defeat in the BoB, and even if he did I doubt he would be willing to reach a deal, considering that German hegemony of the continent was a direct threat to the Empire Halifax would be trying to preserve. \\n TL;DR: Hitler: Deal or no deal, Herr Halifax?

It gave each nation a large enemy for which it could justify its military industrial complex. It also gave them a handy rebut to anyone questioning economic philosophy.

Plus, by the time of Prohibition's repeal the country had bigger fish to fry (like the Depression).  So that colors things a bit. \\n Now let's toss in another issue: public perception may have been that crime was up even when it was not.  For example, the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre occurred in a Chicago that was actually quite safe (10.5 murders per 100,000) compared to Chicago in 1990 (34.5 murders per), but the Massacre was notorious and carried in all of the papers. \\n Let's toss in something else: today.  Oftentimes when people discuss Prohibition it's in the context of the Drug War or the growth of the nanny state.  It's in their interest to portray Prohibition negatively.  Despite honest attempts at neutrality folks cannot help but view the past through the lens of today.  We are not going to get an unbiased point of view until we have more emotional distance from Prohibition.

Many of the sculptures on Easter Island have long ears, were cut out of stone like many Buddhas, and are in a standing position with hands around their waist almost like they were meditating.  Over the years, many historians and archeologists have suggested that Easter Island was related to various other civilizations including the Inca, Tamil, and Chinese (even aliens) to explain their construction.  After seen just how huge these statues are, it is hard for many Westerners to believe that a few thousand people living in scattered villages could have done this without vast engineering and technological know-how. \\n However, those claims are not supported by archeological evidence.  After all, India and China are both separated from Easter Island by 10,000 miles or more, and there is no evidence that they ever sailed that far east.  That being said, there are statues of similar style found on other Polynesia islands including Hawaii, Marquesas, and the Austral Islands.  This has led historians to believe that constructing stone platforms and statues were part of a shared cultural tradition among different Polynesian colonizers.  Although the islanders constructed far more statues than any other island, the purpose of these statues remained rooted in this cultural tradition of Polynesian religion and ancestral worship. \\n tl;dr probably not \\n',\n  0),\n ('In modern times, the best answer is that the Fourth Geneva Convention (1949) specifically outlaws  political  assassinations in warfare.

The US response was to adamantly deny it was an assassination attempt.  My point being, even that early into the war, assassination was off the table, and the propaganda made it was why: both sides considered it scandalous and shameful. \\n The ultimate strategic objective of war is to maintain your side\\'s morale, while forcing the morale collapse of your opponent.  The outrage of assassinating a king will probably boost the enemy\\'s morale, while the shamefulness of doing so can demoralize your own side. \\n But surely you think, aren\\'t some leaders really  that  important (The Great Man Theory)?

It came to be called the \"discovery doctrine,\" and it was infamously spelled out by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall in [Johnson v. M\\'Intosh]( in 1823, by which point it was already a long-established principle & practice in law, going back to the first colonies. It\\'s worth reading through at least the main points: \\n >On the discovery of this immense continent, the great nations of Europe were eager to appropriate to themselves so much of it as they could respectively acquire. Its vast extent offered an ample field to the ambition and enterprise of all, and the character and religion of its inhabitants afforded an apology for considering them as a people over whom the superior genius of Europe might claim an ascendency. The potentates of the old world found no difficulty in convincing themselves that they made ample compensation to the inhabitants of the new by bestowing on them civilization and Christianity in exchange for unlimited independence. But as they were all in pursuit of nearly the same object, it was necessary, in order to avoid conflicting settlements and consequent war with each other, to establish a principle which all should acknowledge as the law by which the right of acquisition, which they all asserted should be regulated as between themselves. This principle was that  discovery gave title to the government by whose subjects or by whose authority it was made  against all other European governments, which title might be consummated by possession. [...] \\n >In the establishment of these relations, the rights of the original inhabitants were in no instance entirely disregarded, but were necessarily to a considerable extent impaired. They were admitted to be the rightful occupants of the soil, with a legal as well as just claim to retain possession of it, and to use it according to their own discretion; but their rights to complete sovereignty as independent nations were necessarily diminished, and their power to dispose of the soil at their own will to whomsoever they pleased was denied by the original fundamental principle that discovery gave exclusive title to those who made it. [...] \\n >Neither the declaration of independence nor the treaty confirming it could give us more than that which we before possessed or to which Great Britain was before entitled. It has never been doubted that either the United States or the several states had a clear title to all the lands within the boundary lines described in the treaty, subject only to the Indian right of occupancy, and that  the exclusive power to extinguish that right was vested in that government which might constitutionally exercise it . \\n This is one of the first cases studied in US law school courses on Property, for the simple reason that to this day \"discovery doctrine\" is fundamental to US property law. What it says in effect is that European nations have a higher level of sovereignty than the nations of indigenous peoples, and therefore a more powerful level of property rights. European nations, and the United States, have \"sovereign\" right to the properties in their territories, but Native Americans have only a \"right of occupancy\" which can be \"extinguished\" at will by the government. \"Right of occupancy\" is thus a second-class property right, also called [aboriginal title]( and it is automatically subordinate to sovereign title. It sounds like the worst form of colonialist legal rationalization for seizure of native lands, but the actual fact is: this is  current  US law. \\n Discovery Doctrine has several implications for US property law, both in regards to Native American tribes and in regard to ordinary citizens attempting to establish title on a piece of land. First, the seizure of Native lands which \"extinguish\" the \"right of occupancy\" is not protected under the Fifth Amendment takings clause, and therefore such a taking is not compensable. The federal government (by Act of Congress, or through a treaty ratified by Congress) does not have to compensate native peoples for the value of their lands unless it wants to...this principle was fully declared in [Tee-Hit-Ton Indians v. United States]( \\n This applies only to aboriginal title. Lands held in fee simple under treaty (Indian Reservations and other established tribal entities & holdings) cannot be alienated/expropriated this way, and government seizure of these lands requires 5th Amendment compensation. \\n Another implication is that aboriginal title is inalienable, except to the government. This means that  only  the US federal government can seize, purchase or otherwise acquire title from native occupants. In a way this part of the doctrine offers some protection to native occupants: they can\\'t have their land bought or seized through court order by a real estate developer or logging company (unless the federal or state gov\\'t say they can). There\\'s no such thing as adverse possession (i.e. squatter\\'s rights or usufruct rights) either, so many of the nasty, shady little ways of obtaining property won\\'t work. \\n That said, native peoples who want to reclaim a piece of land once belonging to their ancestors...in order to establish a legal treaty-bound reservation, for example...are pretty much up a creek if Congress has decided it would rather do other things with the land. \\n The  Johnson v. M\\'Intosh  decision is despised almost as much as the infamous  Dred Scott  decision, since it establishes a deeply Eurocentric view of the inherent superiority of European people, law and nations. And yet, it remains on the books and in force through Supreme Court decisions. The decision is regarded as embarrassing & antediluvian, and in fact the courts have begun to dismantle & chip away at the edges, offering & ordering payments for \"unconscionable compensation\" and other remedies for the centuries of expropriation. But the core principle, unlike in  Dred Scott , is still intact. \\n TL;DR - under current US law, lands originally belonging to / occupied by native inhabitants are automatically controlled by the US federal gov\\'t (and states acting under its sovereignty), with native \"title\" to the land automatically superseded by federal sovereignty. All your lands are belong to us. \\n',\n  0),\n ('My goodness yes! Yes, yes, very much! If it\\'s alright, I am going to post again a comment that I made a few months ago. I am going to edit it slightly, because I was drunk. It is also a WALL of text, so forgive me for that as well! \\n The first thing to understand is that dead people have such amazing charge. People care about them. That seems obvious, but... but why is it obvious? The person is dead - their body has technically become an object. What\\'s the difference between a dead body and any other object? It seems weird that we would throw a broken plate into the rubbish bin while treating something equally not alive as the focal point for myth and memory. \\n Right now the reader is saying \"Crossy, you moron, they were a person! They have meaning and emotion attached to them. People loved them. People don\\'t care about a broken plate.\" Yep; when something is a \\'person\\' it is suddenly the focus for many, many identities - those identities get mapped by other people onto its (probably human) body. Like masculinity is mapped onto the penis, for instance, or femininity onto the womb. \\n So when people die their bodies stay, and those identities linger; the body can therefore be used by other people as a kind of metaphor. A signifier, if you will, for what the dead person was. That\\'s why the outrage is intense if that dead body is messed with; that\\'s why its pretty vital even today to the grieving process for families have a body. An empty grave is just not satisfying to visit - it is empty - even though the person is dead inside the grave or out of it. \\n And because a grave a site of dense richness, oh does modern war bugger grieving patterns. Those Great War cemeteries with their ranks of war dead interred near or in the battlefield where they died? Profoundly unnatural. All politics. The bodies were co-opted in death as they had been conscripted in life. Stolen for their \"charge\" and richness of meaning. \\n I use the word \\'stolen\\' in a very real sense, because in the normal course of death, bodies are returned to their families. Naturally some of the men like the Kiwis, Canadians, and Aussies were simply too far away to be returned; those countries accepted their burden, but still had hundreds and hundreds of letters and personal appeals for photos, information, witnesses. \\n As for Britian; the Imperial War Graves Commission stole those bodies. A bloke named Ware decided that the mass of dead was a glorious opportunity. He argued up, down, and sideways until it was a matter of policy that no bodies would be returned from the Great War to any Commonwealth country - not even at private expense. The bodies in his vision were ordered, their emotional connection and understandings layered into cemetery-memorials to Empire. A place of pilgrimage for the entire Commonwealth that would strengthen all the bounds between the countries by reminding them of their common sacrifice. I wish I was making this up, because it depresses me, but I am not. \\n It depresses me because this usurpation of bodies caused profound unhappiness - in Britishers especially, because the bodies were right there. Some of the rich folks nipped across and grabbed their sons without telling anyone, but even that was stopped pretty soon, and the poor never even got the opportunity too. I read a really heartbreaking letter from a mother which read \"you took my son away from me in life and now you take him away from me in death\". \\n And the result of all of this? Grief. Unending grief. Mourning for the Great War keeps going - people couldn\\'t tend their family member\\'s grave, or visit it, or even know if there was one. Men were blown to pieces, or were buried in mud - completely missing. Had people ever had that before, on such a massive scale? Not just the disruption to mourning practices to not have a body or a grave, but not having a grave at all? And the grief was so total - back before the war folks in England would hang out black drapes, all their neighbors came around with food, and family would appear. During the Great War visible grief was frowned upon - after all, the casualties were so heavy, what made your boy so special? If you can\\'t mourn like you need to, and your support network is broken, and you don\\'t have a body, then your grief goes on and on. \\n Those cemeteries which we all take for granted now, and which steal your breath - they are an abomination. They are the government saying \"these men were more important in their identity as soldiers of empire than they were in any identity they ever had as father or husband or son or nephew.\" Ware and his Imperial War Graves Commission imposed what HE believed those soldiers were onto their bodies. Not the identity that the soldier had believed. Not what the family believed. Only Ware could decide. \\n Isn\\'t that a bit sad? \\n The best book on all of this is by a man named Bart Ziino, and it\\'s called \"A Distant Grief\". It\\'s a really readable book, except for the subject matter. \\n Now, the Imperial War Graves Commission policy was a Big Change from before. Prior, bodies were often buried where foreign battles - but they could have been brought home had the family the inclination. Plus, the British troopers were regulars, who often had their wives and children with them on campaign. Grief practices could be done \"on site\", as it were. No way was the government going to get in the way of that, because  the government didn\\'t claim to own the bodies . \\n In the First World War though, there was no way to get the bodies back. The War Graves Commission had plans for those bodies which didn\\'t involve the families. It involved Empire building, places of pilgrimage, and general veneration of \"British values.\" \\n Grief in New Zealand and Australia in the First World War had much more acceptance of the lack of bodies - distance modifies the rules of mourning. Pretty much the deaths in the First World War were treated (at the time! Later on it changed!) like the deaths New Zealanders and Aussies had prior, like in the Boer war. Except bigger. Much bigger. \\n The scale of death was definitely a factor in why the Imperial War Graves Commission decision was so bad - it was a decision made in a new context where properly demonstrative grief wasn\\'t being socially allowed in the various Commonwealth countries. The support system had been strained past the point where it could cope with all the loss. Does that make sense? And the lack of bodies - bodies which were essentially just a hop, skip, and a jump away - only made these things worse because traditional middle-class things like tending the graves etc simply couldn\\'t be done. It was just appalling. We\\'re still dealing with the grief from it, and its nearly a century later. \\n The French, now they tried to do the same thing - they made large military cemeteries as well. But Frenchmen weren\\'t putting up with that bullshit when they lived nearby the cemeteries, and simply paid people to pinch the bodies of their sons in order to bring them home again. After awhile, the \"theft\" problem became so endemic that the French government allowed bodies to be returned to their families if those families desired: about a third took the government up on this offer. \\n TL:DR Yes! Lots of people were upset! It caused a LOT of social problems. \\n',\n  0),\n ('The locations of heavy industry was well known to RAF planners before the outbreak of the second world war.

These nations were the most recognizable to Europeans, primarily because they had had contact with similarly organized nations before. Their Abrahamic faith also helped Christian Europe to recognize these states as somewhat \"civilized\" (something of a nebulous term, as we\\'ll shortly examine), if perhaps not quite as perfect as European Christian monarchies and empires. \\n The African empires. There\\'s actually more of these than people realize, and they do tend to make appearances in European histories despite being largely black and non-Abrahamic in their faiths. The most recognizable of these is probably the Zulu, though several other cultures in nations like modern Mali or Zimbabwe managed to forge respectable nations without European help. \\n The tribes. This is the stereotype of Africa that Europeans saw the most of, and it largely colored Europe\\'s perception that Africa was \"uncivilized\" or, as the Victorians termed it, the \"Dark Continent\". \\n \\n Generally, one of two things happened to these aforementioned nations: they were conquered by a Western European state, or they were absorbed into the Ottoman Empire only to be ripped away and be conquered by - you guessed it - a European state. And the Europeans made one cardinal mistake that would come back post-colonialism: they didn\\'t care a whit about ethnic lines. \\n Africa generally got carved up by seven nations in the late 19th century: Britain, France, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Belgium, and Germany. Each left behind their own unique brand of dysfunction: \\n \\n Britain was probably the least-bad of all these nations, because they generally set up some sort of parliamentary system with a semi-native run bureaucracy. The hallmark of British colonies is the struggle between blacks and whites following independence on the subject of rights and equality, most notably in Kenya, Rhodesia (modern Zimbabwe), South Africa, and Uganda (though Idi Amin takes that struggle to a whole new level). \\n France tended to set up a Franco-centric system, where locals tended not to have too many rights at all. French colonies are mostly characterized by violent separation from France and by cyclical civil war, often spurred on because of claims of foreign intervention or interference in local affairs. \\n I honestly don\\'t know too much about Portugal\\'s colonial legacy, mostly because their colonies tend not to be big enough to end up as major nations (excluding Brazil, of course). Perhaps another redditor can deal with this. \\n Spain never really got a large slice of Africa. What they did get was Morocco, whose colonial legacy largely consists of being the launching point for Franco\\'s insurrection in 1936 and for getting more or less annexed by the Axis in World War II. Morocco seems to have turned out alright (that is to say, without too many flagrant human rights abuses and with a somewhat stable government), but again this isn\\'t my area of expertise. \\n Italy\\'s legacy in Africa is perhaps the funniest (in a black humor sort of way), simply because Italy failed spectacularly at setting up any kind of empire at all. Italy only got three real colonies: Tripoli (modern Libya), Italian Somaliland (which is still trying to secede from Somalia), and Ethiopia (which they had to invade twice to acquire and which defeated them roundly the first time). Ethiopia is the exception to the African rule: it is a major Christian nation and had been for a long time before Europeans showed up in force, and until the 60s was a major power unto itself. I\\'m not sure its current problems can be blamed on Europe - the politics of the Cold War are probably a larger culprit, coupled with a few disastrous famines. \\n Belgium. Dear God, Belgium. If Britain treated its subjects like mentally handicapped younger siblings, then Belgium was the psychopath child who thought of its subjects as stray cats and tortured them as it saw fit. Belgium really only got the Congo, but that\\'s a huge tract of territory, and some estimates put the death toll inflicted by Belgium upon this land as high as  ten million . To this day the Congo has had only one somewhat stable government, led by Mobutu Sese Seko (a megalomaniacal dictator), and most of the rest of its history has been spent on very shaky ground or in crisis. \\n Germany\\'s legacy is complicated. Germany didn\\'t get much of value out of Africa, but they are notable for engaging in genocide in what is now Tanzania (an event which some historians argue set the stage for the Holocaust years later), and for losing all of its colonies to Britain and France after World War I. I would argue that the aftershocks of decolonization rest more on the shoulders of these two nations than on Germany in the aforementioned lands. \\n \\n Now, to the process of decolonization. My personal view (unpopular as it may be) is that the process of decolonization was too sudden in Africa, that the colonizers didn\\'t have enough time or resources to prepare their African holdings for independence as had been done in India, and that this haphazard abandonment caused a lot of serious problems for the new nations. Once again, we come back to the problem of ethnic lines: sometimes national borders split ethnic groups apart, causing wars of annexation or independence. Sometimes national borders lumped together ethnic groups who hated each other (see the Biafran War and the Rwandan Genocide). Sometimes national governments were built to mimic their colonial predecessors, which caused serious issues with discrimination and outright racist oppression (see South Africa and Rhodesia). Nations that had never really contained more than tribes were suddenly expected to get over their differences and live in harmony. African empires of old were broken to pieces and rearranged along lines determined by committees that didn\\'t understand or care about the implications of doing so. But mostly I would say that Europeans put together governments that just couldn\\'t or wouldn\\'t work for the locals, as shown by the endless cycle of coups, civil wars, and purges that take place across the continent with saddening regularity. Perhaps it\\'s not Europe\\'s fault for ignoring the fact that their preferred post-colonial regimes just weren\\'t what was wanted or needed by locals, or perhaps it\\'s the fault of the Soviet and American blocs of the Cold War for playing these nations off each other and off themselves for profit or power or influence. But the truth is, in my opinion, that much of Africa simply wasn\\'t ready to be thrust into a world about which the majority of the population had never been educated or even cared about. And to this day it\\'s perhaps highly symbolic that even the great destabilizing forces in African conflicts tend to resemble either the tribes of old or crude facsimiles of the European militias they constantly try to emulate. \\n tl;dr:  Europeans interfere in African affairs, break up everything the locals understand or are used to, then abandon largely uneducated and unprepared populaces to often corrupt or incompetent \"local\" governments, leading to civil wars and coups and generally one huge mess. \\n One last word: I would really appreciate if other redditors would correct me on the finer points of this - you know, for the betterment of everyone\\'s understanding. \\n',\n  0),\n ('You may have missed [this recent META post]( in which we clarified that: \\n >  Simply throwing a link up is also a bit lazy \\n > If you are linking to a web site or another /r/askhistorians thread that already answered this question, please give a \"TL;DR\" for the links. \\n Could you please explain to the OP which part/s of that article are relevant, and how? \\n',\n  0),\n ('Pardon me if I rant or something like that, but I want to clarify that \"It used to be a sign of wealth\" should not mean that the elite was generally fat or even looked favorably on being fat. Maybe this misses the point of the question from OP, but I would say that there is a \"traditional\" imperative for the elite to be strong and lean rather than being \"sexy\" \"fat\". \\n The need to \"work out\" as an elite was always evident. A lot of Bronze Age culture had traditions that their leaders had to hunt. An example would be the Pharao hunting lions, hippopotami and such with a bow or a spear.\\nIn the myths of the Hellenes, the heros always have to use their strengh; Herakles, Odysseus, Achilles. In Plutarch\\'s Live of Alexander, Alexander was the best sportsman around. (He, for instance, won a naked (foot) race around the burial ground of Achilles, but he also boxed and wrestled - he was quite a greek TR).\\nThe Romans didn\\'t put the emphasis on sports that much, but as they saw the army as the best way to get prestige as a patrician, their ideal patrician also was capable of fighting: strong and lean. \\nThe societies that followed also put an emphasis on the \"being fit for fighting\" - part for the elite. The descriptions of Charlemagne all state that he was quite an impressive specimen (as a certain character from a popular fantasy series would say). The Alexiad states explicitly how lean and strong the leaders of the Crusade (the Normans in particular) were. \\nOf course, the hunt was the most important exercise, but also other martial exercises.\\nAs part of the Renaissance, there was also a \"rebirth\"\\nof exercises for the elite, in \"Il Libro del Cortegiano\" there are some exercises stated which would supposedly fit a courtier - gymnastics for example. Why? Because a courtier had to be strong and lean to be fully effective. In most cases, being fat was - as it is now - seen as a personal flaw. The view of the Church that glutony is a cardinal sin, didn\\'t help. Just look at Sir Falstaff. His corpulence just supports his other flaws. \\n While the fat being \"sign of wealth\" can be true for certain periods of time and certain parts of society, the general rule is that the ruling elite would rather be lean. [If we look at the pictures of Rubens, the only really fat people are the women, the men are toned, few are a little chubby, but always muscular. This is a little strange if you see a nearly naked Francis of Assisi who\\'s muscle are quite defined.] \\n And this simply didn\\'t change in most parts of the world. The consensus is that fat people are not to be taken as serious as leaders as lean people; we are cultural imprinted that way, for whatever reason. (Like in fat people do not get paid as much as lean people, they do not rise as quick in the ranks, etc. etc.) \\n TL, DR: The elite always was generally as an ideal on the lean side. And as the next \"lower\" classes tend to imitate the elite - at least until now, they would also try to be lean rather than to be fat. \\n',\n  0),\n ('That\\'s very true, Germania did Romanize over the years. Modern historiography on the frontiers of the Empire is very clear that there was no real \"border\" to the Empire as we think of states having today. Trade and immigration were plentiful and relatively unencumbered on the frontier. Someone living 10 miles East of the Rhine likely considered himself just as Roman as his counterpart 20 miles West. There\\'s also evidence that Rome held considerable political control over the tribes in Germania during the early-mid Imperial periods. Rome might intercede in struggles or disputes in Germania and would receive tribute from the powerful chieftains/tribes there. Armies would march to skirmishes in Germania quite often. \\n As far as extending her formal control farther into Germania... it probably would have been  more  feasible later on, but still not very practical. The Elbe was primarily valuable because it was the main highway for the lucrative amber trade. Rome could already exert considerable influence on this trade route through her informal connections with tribes in Germania and would not have a lot to gain by moving its legions even farther away from the Mediterranean basin. It gets forgotten often, but the legions on the Rhine were already the most far-flung of Rome\\'s permanently stationed troops (excepting Britain\\'s few legions). All other legions were much closer to the Mediterranean basin. Moving the legionary forts an  additional  ~250 miles away from Rome\\'s base of power would have stretched the Empire quite thin indeed. \\n From the Principate through the crisis of the third century, the Rhine legions were primarily supplied by a long, government-subsidized trade route from the Mediterranean. It would have been difficult and likely very expensive to extend this far all the way to the Elbe. There are no obvious trade routes from Rhine to Elbe (most rivers run north to south there) like there are from Mediterranean to Rhine. Its also likely that Rome would have had to increase its number of legions to maintain that amount of territory, which would also be very expensive. \\n tldr: I just don\\'t see it happening. Lots of cost for little gain. \\n edit: added a sentence \\n',\n  0),\n (\"My research has focused on socio/cultural patterns in Imperial Gaul, so I hope I can shed some light onto this subject for you. I'll try to keep it succinct and brief. You are right that there were several attempts made in the early Principate to extend the  imperium  of the Empire to the Elbe river in Germania but that they mostly stopped during Tiberius' reign. This was likely because subsequent Emperors realized the futility of trying to incorporate the land between the Rhine and Elbe into the formal Empire. \\n Prior to Romanization, Gaul and Germania were socially and economically similar, but geography would turn out to be the key determinant of their divergent paths. In the decades between Caesar's conquest of Gaul and the reign of Tiberius, Gaul was completely transformed. Gauls moved from their small, fortified hill villages into large, prosperous cities. Trade increased, the population increased and centralized and Gauls started adopting more Roman habits and ways of life. This in turn allowed the Romans to rule more easily. Roman imperial governance worked best when it was administered through cities. It was easier for legions to hold an area from a large urban area and easier to supply them when locals already are used to producing and importing excess goods and food. \\n Crucially, none of this transformation happened on the other side of the Rhine. And it was exceedingly difficult to replicate the conditions that made it possible in Gaul. When it was conquered, Gaul (southern Gaul at least) was already integrated into the Mediterranean world, the seat of Roman power. And it was relatively easy to extend Rome's trade routes up the Rhone and then from there down the Moselle to the Rhine in order to supply the Roman troops stationed in Gaul. This trade route was instrumental in the development of Gaul and it was primarily along this route that Gaul Romanized and urbanized. \\n When invading Germania, the Roman legions encountered the same village-based social order they had in Gaul decades earlier, but were unable to affect any meaningful change there or to properly assert their control over the area. There were no major population centers to hold and none developed because the legions' supply lines only reached to the Rhine in the winter months. So every winter, Rome would retreat to the Rhine, their enemies would re-group and in spring they would return to a Germania that was essentially unchanged from the year before. Eventually, Rome decided it would be better to just trade with the barbarians and fight with them every now and again rather than trying to conquer them. Sorry that's a bit abbreviated, if you have any other questions/need for clarification I can be more thorough :) \\n Tldr: Area between Rhine/Elbe was not socially compatible with effective Roman rule and Rome had limited means to make it so.

Originally, an  imperator  was one who held the  imperium , or the power of a magistrate. It comes from  imperare , to command, rule, order. The  imperator  had absolute power inside his area of responsibility, borders were set by for example other holders of  imperium  of a higher rank, by a veto or by a majority decision of other executive bodies. As a sign of his power, an  imperator  was accompanied by  lictores  carrying  fasces , a bundle of wooden rods, sometimes with an axe inside; incidentally also the origin of the symbol and word 'fascism' and still a powerful symbol of republicanism today. \\n Offices that brought an  imperium  with them were: \\n \\n Dictator , accompanied by 24 lictors outside of Rome, 12 within. His lictors kept the axe, as his powers included capital punishment even within Rome.  \\n Consul , 12 lictors \\n Praetor , 6 lictors, inside of the ritual boundary of Rome, the  pomerium , two. \\n Magister equitum , the master of the horse and assistant to the dictator, 6 lictors \\n Aedilis curulis , the Curule Aedils, 2 lictors, though it's a matter of debate if they always had the  imperium  as part of their magistrate. \\n \\n From the third century BC on, it increasingly referred to a military commander, the holder of military imperium. This was a title bestowed upon a victorious commander by his soldiers, a process known as acclamation. The soldiers proclaimed him  imperator , and he held that title until entering the sacred bounds of Rome, usually in triumph (if he could convince the Senate to be granted one). It was thus an incredibly prestigious title. \\n During Augustus' time, Imperator became part of his official name as Imperator Caesar Divi Filius, the so-called  praenomen imperatoris . \\n Augustus \\n Augustus is simply a honorific bestowed upon Octavian on 17. January 27 BC, meaning 'the venerable', from  augere  which is related to 'augment'. His successors continued to use it as an honorific part in their official title. \\n Caesar \\n Caesar is the name of a family of the  gens Iulia , which C. Iulius Caesar belonged to. Members of that family carried the cognomen Caesar to differentiate from other branches of the house. When Iulius Caesar adopted Gaius Octavius, Caesar became part of his name (he was then named C. Iulius Caesar Octavianus (Augustus)), and he continued to use it to help solidify his claim as  the  successor to Caesar. In turn it became part of the names of the other emperors belonging to the Iulian-Claudian line. \\n However, the last emperors of that line were not directly related by blood to the Iulian family, and Caesar became part of their official title and the title of all following emperors. From the time of Galba on, Caesar was also given as a title to the designated successors, by the time of Antoninianus exclusively to the eldest son/designated successor of the emperor. The reigning emperors were  Imperator Caesar Augustus , while their successors were only  Caesar  or  Imperator Caesar ; thus Augustus was the title given exclusively to the reigning emperor. \\n Under the reign of  Domitian  Diocletian, this changed again as in the tetrarchy there were two superior emperors, the  augusti , and two subordinate emperors, the  caesares , who were also the designated successors to one of the  augusti . \\n Vitellius broke with that tradition a bit in that he left out the title 'Caesar' for its monarchic connotations and had himself named  consul perpetuus , everlasting Consul, as he wanted to associate himself more with the Republic. \\n So, tl;dr: Imperator was part of the official name of an emperor and some successors, Caesar was the title of emperors and their successors, and Augustus was the title of an emperor. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"I'm afraid I'm slightly limited on that front. My A level course is called From Pitt to Peel, the Pitt in question being Pitt the Younger(damn political dynasties confusing the meaning), and the Pitt the Younger government was remarkably stable, despite the turbulent politics of the time. That said the full story of how he became PM illustrates pretty excellently the tension between royal influence and parliamentary independence. The bit I've told you about reveals the general truth bu the full story reveals some of the nuances. \\n Basically it all starts when Lord North falls from power having headed the government which lost the American Revolutionary War. Now his obvious replacement is Fox, head of the opposition outspoken opponent of the war (even turning up in revolutionary uniform to the House of Commons) and brilliant orator. Two problems, the king is known to actively despise him and its accepted that the king has the right to ministers he gets on with, although he is expected to appoint a man that parliament trusts. I suppose the best way to put it is that parliament is expected to support someone the king likes and the king is expected to support someone parliament likes. Two he doesn't quite have the numbers to form a government by himself. So he allies with the influential Lord Shelburne (who he dislikes intensely, but politics makes strange bedfellows) and they appoint Rockingham as figurehead PM. They take influential roles within the government and run things unofficially. With me so far? \\n Ok, now the king isn't to happy but decides to lump it for the moment. However crisis occurs when Rockingham dies unexpectedly and the king asks Shelburne to serve as his PM. Fox refuses to serve under Shelburne and leaves the government. Next comes a rather dramatic political turn around. Having bitterly lambasted North during the war Fox now allies with him to bring down the Shelburne administration. Combining their followings they engineer Shelburne's fall and form the Fox-North coalition government, with the Duke of Portland as another figurehead PM. As one, neither would be inferior to the other, and two the king hates Fox and now hates North who he sees as betraying him by allying with Fox. The scene is now set. \\n The king is well and truly pissed off by this point as he feels this government has been forced on him against his royal prerogative. He begins to cast about for alternatives but all the major political players were sucked into this bun fight and Fox-North emerged victorious. He needs someone new... He turns to Pitt the Younger, fresh to the HofC but a rising star and the son of the incredibly impressive Pitt the Elder (now dead). Pitt turns him down at first, probably correctly guessing he couldn't form a feasible government at this stage. The king then engineers a crisis to bring down the government by basically instructing the HofL to block a key government bill. When this happens he then claims this failure demonstrates the government has lost the faith of the people (a lie and everyone knows it, the bill was blocked as he said so), dismisses the government and appoints Pitt (who's decided the time is right to accept). \\n Now this is MASSIVELY controversial. Fox has a good deal of sympathy from parliament that feels the King has overstepped his authority. Pitt meanwhile is portrayed as an arrogant young puppet of the King and his government is not expected to last more than a a few months. Things don't look good for Pitt, he's a minority government, he has no major following of his own and the backing of no influential MPs. It's expected parliament will reject him. Pitt deals with this in two ways one he uses the King's patronage to buy huge amounts of support, he ennobles anyone who's prepared to trade their support in return focusing on those who control blocks of MPs (patronage is a huge thing). While it was standard to create new peers in return for support the amount he creates is rather remarkable. He can do this as the King supports him. However he also makes a point of not dissolving parliament early and seeking to win an election(which the King suggested), in order to one, prove he can hold his own in the HofC and is not just a puppet, two win as much support as he can amongst the MPs before he calls a new election, and three win support among the electorate (only a small percentage of the population but still v. useful). Meanwhile Fox fritters his support away, he is so outraged at the King's intervention, which he sees as akin to European tyranny, he launches very bitter attacks on the king coming near to denying he has the right to chose his ministers. This extremism undermines his own base of support. \\n When Pitt finally does call a general election a few months later the HofC is divided roughly equally between him and Fox. However in the subsequent election he thrashes Fox, who has been rather successfully painted as disloyal and even revolutionary (playing on the fears of the ?French Revolution which had broken out across the Channel). Here the King could only have exerted a little influence, so while Pitt being seen as a loyal servant of the King in a time of uncertainty helped, Pitt wins on his own merits proving he's not just a puppet. The fact he feels the need to do so quite nicely illustrates the importance of parliamentary independence in the political outlook of the time. \\n Pitt goes on to rule for 16 successful years, and while he rose due to the help of the King he stays there as he's extremely competent. Furthermore his good relationship with the King means the King stays out of politics, even when Pitt proposes parliamentary reform which the king privately opposes. The reform is defeated but not because of the king. \\n TL;DR No new examples just a more fleshed out explanation. In Georgian politics while the King retains massive theoretical power he's expected not to exercise it, politics basically consists on the King and parliament finding someone who they can bot accept as PM. The King is not supposed interfere with specific policies, although his choice in leadership influences the govs direction. When this compromise breaks down the King can assert his authority but it's controversial and he's expected to appoint someone competent. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('Prior to the probably around the late 19th century, the US and Russians were fairly close allies.

I think the big thing to remember is that Justinian ruled for a long time and it is clear that by the end of the reign he was despised by a lot of people. I don\\'t think this was the case in 527. He certainly had his detractors, as his background must have angered the traditional aristocracy of Constantinople and his initial reforms certainly annoyed the capital\\'s many bureaucrats. This is perhaps best shown through the Nika Riots (or Revolt as some historians like to call it). However, Justinian\\'s early years did see some pretty major successes, as the reconquest of North Africa, the completion of his legal codification project, and the rebuilding of Constantinople won him a lot of support. In the 540s however this changed, since the Gothic War dragged on and on, whilst the Persians won a stunning victory and sacked Antioch, a catastrophe that was quickly followed by the plague. The disasters continued for the rest of Justinian\\'s reign. The nomadic Kutrigurs attacked Constantinople, various earthquakes struck the capital and led to the collapse of the dome of Hagia Sophia, and a ridiculous number of conspiracies to overthrow the emperor were discovered, to name a few lowlights of these troubled years. \\n In my opinion, Justinian was clearly an energetic ruler, but that did not mean that he was particularly talented. His policies worked well in the 530s, since the Vandals and the Ostrogoths (and later the Visigoths) were weak and on the brink of civil war, so the Roman interventions were initially very successful. When his enemies were led by talented men like Khusro I for the Persians or Totila for the Ostrogoths however things became more difficult. Justinian had also tried to reform the government, yet it is clear that the new Roman regime in North Africa and Italy actually angered a lot of people, mostly because of its inherent corruption and nepotism, so for all his rhetoric of renewal and reform, Justinian failed to solve the problems plaguing his government. When trouble began, he relied on brutal force and a cabal of advisors (all of whom were seemingly involved in conspiracies against each other), which unsurprisingly did not lead to good governance of the empire. Justinian is a very complex figure and even modern historians are divided on this (James O\\'Donnell for example blamed Justinian for bringing down the western empire in his  The Ruin of the Roman Empire  (2008)). I wouldn\\'t say that he was a bad emperor, but his reign clearly had some major failures that have to be viewed together with his successes. His legacy was troubling for his successors too. A court poet for Justin II for example mentioned that \"the old man no longer cared\" about the state and focused only on religious matters when discussing Justinian\\'s last years in his panegyric to the new emperor, whilst other sources mentioned Justinian\\'s turn to the miaphysite heresy just before his death. \\n I think Procopius exemplifies this. I don\\'t see any reason why Procopius would be angry about Justinian in the 530s and his deep anger only rose to the surface in the late 540s/early 550s when he started to compose his  Wars  and the  Secret History . By then he had many reasons to be angry - his boss, Belisarius, had been disgraced, the wars in the east and the west were not going well, and Justinian\\'s involvement in theological debate in order to solve a schism had backfired spectacularly. Procopius\\' treasonous thought is I think very visible in his  Wars , since through subtle allusions to classical literature he made it clear that in his opinion Justinian was an innovator (a bad thing back then) and a tyrant. It couldn\\'t be too obvious, since Procopius\\' history was a work written to be consumed by the educated public, but the hints are there. Procopius was not alone in this, since quite a few other authors criticised Justinian at the same time: John Lydus and the anonymous author of a philosophical dialogue are the two best examples, as both individuals were closely involved in the administration/court and critiqued the government through veiled references. \\n As you know, in his  Secret History  Procopius was much more obvious in his hatred for the regime. According to a recent and very convincing article, Procopius wrote the  Secret History  to ingratiate himself with the court faction associated with Germanus, one of Justinian\\'s cousins who was also a decent general, a group that was seemingly on the verge of taking power from Justinian, so it made sense for him to write a diatribe criticising everything and everyone related to the old regime. So from my perspective this is easily reconcilable with the depiction found in  Wars , since Procopius just exaggerated wildly the opinions he already held. What is more problematic is Procopius\\' glowing review of Justinian found in his  Buildings , a panegyric dedicated to the emperor\\'s building projects. I don\\'t think there is an answer to this, since literally all we know about Procopius comes from his three works and a brief comment found in Agathias, so there is a lot of debate about this. One interesting suggestion that I agree with is that Procopius was involved in a conspiracy against Justinian that was discovered, but the  historian was not overly punished for this and he therefore wrote this encomium to praise the emperor to the skies to thank Justinian for his mercy. \\n tl;dr - Justinian and Procopius are very complicated and I don\\'t think there will be a consensus on either of them any time soon. \\n',\n  0),\n ('While feats shown in movies are embellished to make for good cinema there is no doubt that armies such as the ancient Romans and Spartans were formidable fighting forces.

Watch production rose from tens of thousands per year in the late 17th century to around 400,000 per year by the end of the 18th century.  De Vries claims, \"In a ten-year span enough timepieces of all types and qualities were then produced to supply one-quarter of the adult males of western and central Europe (the putative customers in the geographical zone where nearly all watches were produced and sold)\" (2). \\n For the more well-to-do, it became increasingly more common toward the end of the century to own a pocket watch.  But it\\'s worth noting that de Vries here is making a generalization about timepieces in general - including clocks.  Curiously, clocks were more common in commercialized rural areas than in towns.  De Vries draws this conclusion by examining probate inventories (i.e. a list of all someone\\'s stuff made after they die), but the numbers vary according to region.  By 1750, 86 percent of all rural households in Friesland had clocks.  In Kent, 54 percent had them, while in Cornwall only nine percent did. \\n De Vries does mention some curious facts, though: according to Parisian probate inventories, 13 percent of servants and five percent of wage earners had watches in 1700; by 1780, it was 70 percent of servants and 32 percent of wage-earners.  Note that pocket watches remained expensive, but they became one of the most common \"impulse buys\" of the eighteenth century. \\n This, however, is based on the records that we have.

Yes, I\\'ve already scanned this thread looking for it.  No dice. \\n If you look at the disposition of Soviet nuclear forces during the Cold War you\\'ll be struck by several things.  First, a rather large number of them were near or right on the edge of major cities.  Second, very few of them were as rigorously hardened or defended against nuclear attack as US forces. \\n This was because the Soviets were generally of the opinion that when WWIII started, they were going to fire first. \\n This makes a lot of sense if you think about it.  Western Europe was always going to be the battle-ground for a full-scale war between the US and the USSR and NATO occupied it already.  The Soviets had to be standing at the British Chanel in a very small amount of time if they were going to deny US armor and supply trains a foothold on the mainland. \\n To that end the Soviets had to move fast and depend upon the element of surprise to crush NATO forces.  Since a full-scale invasion of Western Europe and the (presumed) numerical superiority of the Soviets in the early ground-war would force the West to use nuclear weapons anyway the USSR\\'s strategic thinking appeared to favor jumping the gun. \\n To that end, the Soviets found themselves somewhat less concerned (though, of course, not entirely unconcerned) with the task of protecting their nuclear weapons, since they\\'d be launching first anyway. \\n Presuming a Soviet First Strike then, the logical targets are what we call \"Counter Force\" targets.  Specifically, those are targets which dramatically and immediately reduce the enemy\\'s capability to make war.  Missile and bomber bases are at the top of this list but are followed by all other military bases, particularly Naval bases, command and control systems, and radar installations. \\n Conspicuously absent from the counter-force targets are major cities.  Leaving cities untouched was thought to give the enemy pause before he launched a counter-strike.  While one presumes that a counter-strike will come, knowing that it too will be returned with attacks upon  civilian targets  -- what we\\'d call \"Counter Value\" targets -- could potentially lead an enemy to accept the losses from the first strike and elect to use only conventional means to respond. \\n Obviously should the enemy -- in this case the USA -- respond with attacks upon Soviet cities and what unmobilized military assets remain that attack would be met with a second strike against population centers etc.  My recollection is that warheads were slated for pretty much every population center greater than 75,000 people. \\n Finally, once the initial exchange is over and done with, a third strike would typically wait in the wings.  Depending on fallout and depopulation from the first two strikes it is assumed that the enemy will move war-time production capacity where it is most efficient.  A final wave of missiles/bombers would be held in reserve to attack these long-term war making capabilities.  In this case we\\'re talking about factories, nuclear processing facilities, power production, etc. \\n TL;DR: Three strikes.  #1 -- Command and Control targets as well as military targets capable of nuclear retaliation.  #2 -- Civilian targets in response to the assumed retaliation for #1.  #3 -- Long term production, munitions storage, logistics targets necessary for a long-term war effort. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Best place to die slowly of nuclear winter, rather than through immediate nuclear damage and fallout. \\n For your reading pleasure, with some anecdotes. \\n A global average surface cooling of –7°C to –8°C persists for years, and after a decade the cooling is still –4°C (Fig. 2).

Kurds are in the southeast, and Alevis are primarily in the center and the southeast (a significant portion, maybe half, of Alevis are Kurds--the Turkish state doesn\\'t like to admit these groups exist so there aren\\'t any reliable numbers).  There is no Alevi autonomy movement because its a pretty weak political identity (since the 20\\'s, Turkic Alevis have tended to support the Republican, secular political parties, and the Kurdish Alevis have often been more Kurdish than Alevi and the Arab \"Alevis\" are Alawsi/Alawites who have more in common with people in Syria than Central Anatolia).  After the Kurds and the Alevis, the next largest is probably the Arabs across in south (principally in Hatay). Those groups all live far away from the Aegean, however.  There have been no significant groups advocating a separate (non-Sunni Muslim Turk) identity in Western Anatolia since the  population exchange in 1923 . \\n Unless you\\'re asking about Turks in Central Asia (like half the -stan countries are Turkic), (again, other than the Kurds) the only place that I can think of that has an active independence or autonomy movement against a Turkic majority is Nagarno-Karabakh, which had a historical Armenian majority but the Soviet Union included in the Azerbaijani SSR. For reference, west of the Caspian, Turkic groups make up notable minorities in Cyprus (independence movement), Iraq (autonomy movement), Bulgaria (ethnic bloc in a parliamentary democracy), Macedonia (similar, but a smaller bloc and I believe often de facto allied with Albanians), and Iran (cultural identity, but no separate politcal faction). \\n Tl;dr there are no independence movements in Western Anatolia because almost everyone there identifies as Turks and Sunni Muslims.

I don't believe its truly possible to definitively state that any single course of action would have been planned and followed through had Hitler been taken alive. While the Moscow Declaration of 1943 did state that punishment for crimes with no specific geographic locale would be handled jointly by the Allied powers, this could be open to interpretation. As the Red Army reached Berlin significantly before the other Allied powers, if Hitler we're alive he would have surely been under Soviet custody. Whether Stalin would claim that the extreme Soviet losses in the course of the war gave a specific geographic locale for (many of) Hitler's crimes and thus allowed themselves to take charge in meting out punishment is a highly likely possibility, it cannot be positively concluded. \\n As for what the specific punishment would have been, as I previously mentioned the thoughts of the Allied leadership on the matter of general post-victory punishment shifted as the war progressed and concluded. There was disagreement over how to punish Nazis generally upon the war's conclusion at the Tehran Conference in 1943. The intent of Stalin (who would have had custody of Hitler) at the conference can be seen in his suggestion to simply summarily execute roughly 50,000 German officers. A simple summary execution (whether under official Red Army auspices or more akin to the fate of Muammar Gaddafi), is certainly one likely possibility. Although the other Allied leaders were somewhat less bloodthirsty than Stalin in their thinking regarding the punishment of Nazi leadership, immediately executing Hitler and definitely ending the war in Europe is a likely scenario. \\n On the note of trials, it is highly unlikely that Hitler would have been prosecuted by the German people. The judiciary of Germany was comprised just about exclusively of Nazi party members. The only Germans who could even theoretically prosecute Hitler somewhat reliably would have been those with communist leanings, which simply puts the ball into Stalin's court regardless. Were a trial to be held under strictly Soviet custody, there is absolutely no doubt that the event would be a show trial in Moscow leading to inevitable execution. If Stalin were instead to abide by the previous arrangement for joint decision making on the punishment of Nazi leadership, Hitler would have been tried jointly by the Allies at Nuremburg or potentially separately at a unique trial for himself alone. It should be noted that, essentially, all roads lead to execution. Any plans for the Denazification of Germany would have been seriously hampered by Hitler still being alive. The risk of Hitler returning, being freed, or acting as a living figurehead for a potential resurgence of Nazism would simply be too great. The only real questions are the exact method leading up to execution, and the extent of involvement from Truman and Churchill in it. \\n The TLDR: Post-war plans for the Nazi leadership in general differed between the Allied leadership. Given that Hitler was not captured alive, it cannot be definitively said that the potential road map for Allied leadership jointly dealing with Nazi leadership would have even been followed in Hitler's case. The only thing for certain is the conclusion: inevitable execution. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('Before the 3rd century you had to be a citizen of Rome to join the army.

Although they would on occasion perform the ‘johnny on the spot’ defensive role seen with the Soviet forces, the main role of the trains was fighting partisans behind the lines, of which there was no shortage of work doing. What new construction was done, such as the BP 42 and BP 44 designs, was heavily influenced by Polish and Soviet innovations, including dismount cars for tanks (usually PzKpfw 38(t)s), and  Panzerjägerwagens  equipped with Panzer IV turrets. But they always remained boxy affairs, looking like the secondary thoughts that they were for German manufacturers. The change of fortunes in 1943 finally began to shift the perspective on trains, and their utility as defensive weapons showed itself clearly to OKH. By late 1944, manufacturing of trains had even been placed at high priority, behind only the new Tiger and Panther tanks, but it was far too late. Finished trains rolled out at a mere trickle - only nine of the new BP-44 design were completed by the end of the war. In all, Germany would only operate some 70 trains through the war, with a high point of 55 with the construction push near the end of the war. \\n As for other nations, armored train use was a decidedly limited affair. The Italians used a small number for anti-partisan activities in Yugoslavia, and the British used about thirteen ungainly examples as [coastal defense platforms in southern England]( - manned mostly by Free Polish forces, whether by coincidence or because of their knowledge of armored trains I’ve never been able to pin down. The British also deployed one in the Middle East during the brief fighting in Iraq. The Allies never deployed them in their advance from 1944-1945, and encountered only a handful of German examples, as the Wehrmacht’s use had been almost exclusively on the Eastern Front. A small number of artillery centric trains and anti-aircraft centric trains were encountered, and a few patrolled in Italy, but that was about the extent of it. \\n Post-War and Decline \\n The Second World War was essentially the last gasp of the armored train as a weapon of conventional warfare. That of course is not to say it disappeared entirely, just that the advances in airpower, and the general direction of tactics and strategy removed its purpose in a regular ground war. But it still could make its mark, especially in the role of anti-insurgency operations, where the mobile forts could protect the rail-lines without much fear of air attack. Soviet trains continued to ply the rails of Ukraine and Poland as they fought the UPA and the so-called ‘cursed soldiers’ of the former  Armia Krajowa  who continued to resist Soviet hegemony into the late 1940s, and some continued to patrol the Trans-Siberian Railroad well into the latter part of the 20th century, especially with deteriorating relations with China. Most of these trains were heavily armed with anti-aircraft weapons, and revolved around the speedy delivery of tanks and APCs to remote regions, where its cargo would do the real fighting. Both the MVD (Interior Affairs) and the military made use of trains in Chechnya in the past two decades (apparently there was actually an excess of them, due to lack of coordination between MVD and military commanders). \\n Aside from trains intended for combat, in the 1980s the Soviets also began mounting SS-24 ICBMs onto trains, a means of preventing easy targeting by American missiles by being constantly mobile. The test launch was considered a success with American spy satalites unable to locate it, and the Americans viewed it as enough of a threat to consider building their own system, although it never came to fruition due to the end of the Cold War. \\n Probably the most well known example was  La Rafale . The Vietminh seem to have made their own armored trains, and there are accounts of the two duking it out inconclusively. \\n Other instances which my sources are unfortunately brief in their mentions of include armored trolleys (ie rudimentary rail-cruisers) deployed by the British during the Malayan Emergency, and armed trains created during the Congo Crisis. Russian trains were involved in the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and multiple groups used improvised trains during the breakup of Yugoslavia. Kim Jong-Il, apparently afflicted with a fear of flying, used an armored train to travel long distances, such as an almost two week ride to reach Moscow in 2001. \\n Looking Back - The TL;DR \\n The vital importance of the railroad for military logistics starting in the mid-19th century, and the inherent vulnerability of the large tracts of unprotected rail, made the development of weaponized trains a virtual inevitability. Although the armored train would reach its height of importance in the early 20th century before airpower came about to offer the easiest and most effective counter, they would continue to show their worth through World War II, and find uses even after that. Prior to the invention of the tank, these land-battleships were the most powerful weapon on wheels when well supported, bringing incredible firepower to bear and never-before possible speed. Although limited by where the rails went, a well manned armored train could nevertheless not just serve as a mobile fort protecting a railroad from attack, but could even be employed as the spearhead of an attack, charging in with guns blazing to disgorge literally hundreds of infantry to overwhelm shocked defenders. \\n Airpower would end the ability of the train to operate with impunity, but by no means were they done for, fighting their way through World War II and beyond. The life span can be split into four phases really. The juvenile stage where the concept hadn’t yet been developed fully (pre-WWI); the mature stage where they operated not just as defensive backstops and behind the lines, but as offensive tools in their own right (Centered on the Russian Civil War); their old age, mostly working behind the lines in a support role (World War II); and their slow death after the war, serving in a counterinsurgency role, but deprived of the ability to operate conventionally. \\n Addendum A: Railroad guns \\n Although early on I touched on the immense mounted artillery role known as the railroad gun (not to be confused with a rail gun), it is worth pointing out that I haven’t really covered them here because they aren’t, strictly speaking, armored trains. Not to say they can’t be, but railroad guns are intended to just provide very heavy artillery support, usually with immense naval guns as in the case of the United States Navy’s Mark I Navy railway mount, which carried a gigantic 14” naval gun, or custom guns such as the infamous Paris Gun which the Germans used in World War One, and mounted a 111 foot, 238mm gun. \\n Railroad guns can have armored protection for their crews certainly, but even then they aren’t usually lumped into the category of armored trains, although armored trains certainly could include artillery cars of impressive caliber. These would weigh in at several hundred tons (compare to an armored train car of maybe 60 tons), and many railroad guns actually required reinforcing of the rails to be fired, or construction of a temporary spur to fire from as they lacked a turret and required the entire car to face in the direction they intended to fire. Through both World Wars, both sides fielded railroad guns, and basically stated, the slow and lumbering railroad gun filled the opposite role of the speedy armored train. \\n Will be continued in part V \\n',\n  0),\n ('The age of Aisha has not \"been controversial for some time now\" (from a historical view of time, anyway).

If the non-aggression pact with the USSR had not been broken, then it is quite likely that the Germans could have succeeded in their air ware against the British, and perhaps even invade by land long before the Americans figured that liberating Europe would be an excellent idea.

Stalin\\'s \"Great Purge\" left the Soviet Officer Corps a bit thin, and without the time that the invasion of France and such provided, the massive Russian armies would have been led by improperly trained officers incapable of defending the Motherland.\\nIt  might also be important to note that the Russians suffered greater casualties than any other involved party, and that the Americans got properly involved fairly late into the war... \\n TL;DR: Neither side could have succeeded without the other. \\n',\n  0),\n ('The ancient Roman calendar (which ours is based on) actually started, more or less, at the  spring  equinox; March was the first month; September was the seventh (septem = 7), October was the eighth (octo = 8), and so on.

This might be quite long-winded, but bear with me. So firearms start becoming really prevalent at the start of the sixteenth century with the development of the matchlock, which made them more practical. Just before this, developments are happening to bring European infantry in line with what the Swiss are doing. They are the foremost infantry of their age, with the major powers relying on them as mercenaries, because their pike tactics are so brutally effective. But they have a tendency to mutiny over missed pay and are generally unreliable. The Germans, French and Spanish want their own national armies which they can rely on, using the same tactics as the Swiss, and they start to replicate Swiss pikemen during the 1490s. They have a problem; the Swiss are highly trained from a young age by experts, while everyone else is trying to produce the same soldiers from untrained peasants and apprentices, and as you can probably imagine, the pike is an ungainly weapon and coordinating a block of pikemen to present a solid wall of spear points is a nightmare. The solution (inspired, in true Renaissance style, by ancient military texts) is drill. Men move not according to the soldier next to them, but according to a rehearsed set of orders carried out precisely. Soldiers are trained to be unquestionably obedient, sergeants are introduced to oversee formations of men and drummers are introduced to provide a cadence so the men can march in step. By the mid-sixteenth century you've got a consensus on how infantry should be used; in blocks of pikemen, marching in step. \\n Firearms are therefore problematic. Keep in mind that in terms of killing power, there really isn't much to distinguish a musket from a crossbow, and existing missile weapons were undoubtedly more accurate. The advantage of the musket was in its low cost and the minimal training it required. And muskets in particular did not encourage new tactics, since crossbowmen and longbowmen could just as easily adopt a loose formation. So you have firearms becoming a necessity because larger and larger armies have to be equipped affordably, but tactics were based upon tight formations of pikemen. Men were controlled through drill, so a swarm of musketeers would be impossible to control. And you've got to protect these men from roaming cavalry. \\n The solution was to incorporate musketeers into pike formations, either by putting a 'sleeve' of musketeers on each side of the unit, or putting a block of musketeers, a 'horn' on each corner, kind of like bastions on a castle wall. Thus the pike and shot tactics which characterised warfare until the late seventeenth century were born. Even as more and more men were armed with muskets, and eventually pikes disappeared with the arrival of the bayonet, close order drill was relied upon even though it had come about as a way to control pikemen, not missile troops. It was the foundation of battlefield tactics, and it couldn't simply be done away with. It took rifled muskets and re-emphasis on personal initiative before open-order formations could become the norm. \\n As for your other points: all those things were required to control men effectively. Flags told men where their leadership was and gave them something to follow and rally round. Uniforms allowed men to recognise their comrades and contributed to esprit de corps, as well as allowing commanders to easily tell where their forces were positioned, same as banners did (and it was about 200 years after the adoption of uniforms before men had weapons that could hope to hit individuals). Instruments provided a cadence for the men to base their drill timings on. All those roles were vital for the effective control of men and without them units would have disintegrated into a disorganised mass; so they were absolutely necessary. \\n TL;DR: Pike tactics were so central that the same system was applied to musketeers. The most important thing was to effectively control your men, and that was far more important than gaining a few more rifles. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('That is a good question. \\n The idea that there can be more available workers than there is work is another way of putting the fallacy that there can be a  general overproduction . Any particular industry can be in a state of overproduction relative to other industries. For example, if people invent a way to grow potatoes twice as efficiently, they likely do not want to buy twice as many potatoes. They would likely rather buy, let us say, the same number of potatoes for half the price. \\n If this happened, then the potato industry would be in a state of overproduction. Around half of the producers of potatoes would go out of business. But with the money they save on buying potatoes, people would have (very slightly) more to spend on buying all other things. These industries would be in a state of underproduction to the same extent as potatoes are in overproduction. The new equilibrium would be found as former potato farmers entered other fields. \\n The above example illustrates what is called \"Say\\'s Law\", or the proposition that all  real demand , or the ability to purchase goods and services, is created by increased supply and is equal to it. (Economists of the classical and Austrian schools endorse this law, first formulated by James Mill and Jean-Baptiste Say, while Marxians and Keynesians deny it.) That means: the problem is producing things, not finding the will to consume them. If the power to produce is there, then the desire will be there (again, for products  in general  not for any specific industry in which there can be too much relative to things we want more). \\n The idea that there could be a general overproduction, where business is simply making more than people want to buy, is absurd when you think about it. Think about how much money you make now, then think about how much you would like to spend if only you could make it by doing the same thing you do now. It is almost certainly more. Or consider the ways in which you could employ another full-time servant to do all of your household chores, if only you had his services for free. \\n That difference, the difference between what you would like to be able to afford and what you can afford, represents the need and desire for additional labor. It is trivial to show that whatever amount of wealth people have at a given time, they would like to have more (and even if they somehow satisfied all of their personal desires, they would like to give some e.g. to research a cure for cancer, or to explore the solar system). And if they would like to have more, that means that there is a need for more work to produce it. \\n If this is true, then why do we have a problem of permanent, widespread unemployment in many countries? After all, it is not simply the case that some people from time to time need to change jobs when they can no longer be profitably employed in their old field (such as TV repairmen), but many people cannot find  any job , or can only find part-time jobs. \\n The reason for this is the minimum wage, licensing laws, legislation that forces employers to bargain with labor unions, unemployment insurance, occupational safety laws, and every other policy that makes it more expensive for an employer to hire a worker (such as Social Security, Medicare, and mandated health insurance). Let us take the minimum wage as an example (all the others work similarly). Suppose that you have a decently skilled worker who can lay fourteen bricks per hour, and an unskilled worker who can lay only five. There seems to be no way that the unskilled worker can be employed if a skilled worker is available. \\n But suppose that the skilled worker wants to be paid $15 per hour, while the unskilled worker asks only for $5 per hour. Then it is more economical to hire him. However, U.S. federal law currently demands that workers be paid no less than $7.25 per hour. If that unskilled worker\\'s most productive application is worth only $5 (the productivity of his labor is what determines this), then he cannot be profitably employed. Some unskilled workers will be lucky enough to land the minimum wage job, but the rest will get a wage of $0 because they will not have a job. \\n Not only are this worker\\'s energies wasted in idleness, but he also represents a drain on other people (which is by no means his fault). If there is government unemployment insurance, the taxpayers have to give up some of their production to fund his consumption. If not, then his friends and family must give him money out of their production. \\n But what if the minimum wage, licensing laws, etc. are repealed? Those lucky workers who already had a job at an artificially high rate (paid for by the unemployment of others) temporarily lose. To take the example of a skilled worker, a lawyer may make less now that he must compete with everyone and not merely those who are members of the bar. Average  money wages  drop to make room for the new workers. But at the same time, more people are working, or are working in jobs that are more efficient for their talents. This greater production causes prices to become lower (i.e. it increases  real wages ). At the same time, the unemployed no longer need to be supported since they can support themselves. Most importantly, if the greater production is carried on over time, within a few years everyone\\'s standard of living has increased so that even those who temporarily lost now are above where they started. \\n Of course, I am presenting the pro-capitalist analysis of the classical and Austrian schools. The Marxians would have you believe that, in the absence of these laws, real wages would be pushed back by \"exploitation of labor\" all the way to the level of 1800 and beyond until every worker got only so much as barely allowed him to eat (if even that). However, I believe that their arguments to defend this claim are very poor. \\n TL;DR:  There are always more jobs than workers because people always want more than they have now. The reason these workers are not currently employed is because it is against the law to do so. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Your version of events is a bit of an idealistic view of the situation. And I mean idealistic in the terms that that is how things would work in a system where other conditions that might affect the situation are ruled out. Similarly, for example, a pendulum in a vacuum will keep on swinging for ever, but in real world conditions such a scenario will never work because of friction. So while the equilibrium between the supply/demand of labor and the price of said labor might happen eventually, how are we to take into account the suffering caused by \"leaving things to nature\" as it were. As a simile, if we have a defunct dam and we blow it up, the resulting balance in water levels is the same as letting the water out in a more gradual fashion. Other effects caused by this are strictly different. \\n It might be, that there will always be a supply of jobs for willing workers as \"Say\\'s Law\" formulates, eventually, but in reality, due to lack of capital in areas of development and the eventual nature of such development, there are situations where the labor is at a distinct disadvantage as opposed to the employer, which will lead to workers accepting jobs out of desperate rational choice, rather than a rational choice between best weighed options. \\n Take into account too, that nothing stops the employer from employing unfair tactics to maintain a disequilibrium that favors the employer, especially in a situation where the social and economical structure gives too much power to the hands of the employer through a biased justice system, for example. Also, while the existence of labor unions might result in a lower salary in very long run for a worker, for the mass of workers it is the perfectly rational thing to do to make their situation better in the shorter span of time and to put more weight against the power of the employer. \\n All of these things have happened time and again in human history and idealizations based too much theoretical framework discount the real human suffering that a \"natural\" equilibrium causes, without any knowledge of how long this future paradise will take. Also, a functional capitalistic system requires a lot of institutions for it to work and ignoring the power structures of the society and how the institutions work is another mistake. \\n This sort of thing is very common with economists and historians of economy, it operates with a lot of hindsight. The common fallacy is to ignore certain things like ethics, for example, from a situation with the point that ethics cannot be described in quantitative terms and when the analysis of the situation is complete, the result is held to apply generally, without there ever being a real handling of what happened to all those unquantifiable variables. \\n Also, I think that you present a false dichotomy, when you represent the argument as marxism vs. capitalism. Certainly there are a lot of proponents of pragmatic and behavioral economics which provide other opinions to the matter. \\n Tl;Dr: While the idealisation you present might work as a model and perhaps with a long enough time frame, it ignores a lot of factors that are present in actual historical situations. \\n',\n  0),\n ('I can answer for medieval Japan, not exactly the same but similar in many ways. \\n But the answer isn\\'t likely to satisfy you.  For most people the idea of regular working hours simply did not exist. \\n Farmers, for example, during the planting and harvesting season would work from the time it was light enough to see until it was too dark to see, 12 to 16 hours a day, without holidays, until the crops were planted or harvested.  Call it 112+ hours a week during harvest. \\n But it was burst work. They\\'d work flat out during those times, but during other times they could work as they pleased, weeding, repairing buildings, doing various handcrafts, etc at whatever pace they liked.  Some reports say as little as 3-6 hours a day, maybe less.  Though corvee labor was often a part of the off season, and when that happened it was again burst, work until you drop, schedules. \\n For those in manufacturing labor was also burst labor.  Take a blacksmith for example.  When there was an order to be filled, the smith would work until it was done, and again there was no concept of an 8 hour work day.  12 hour days were the usual approach when there was work to be done, and 16 hour days were not uncommon if the work needed doing or multiple orders had stacked up.  Again, this was burst work, if there wasn\\'t an order to be done they\\'d build horseshoe blanks, or nails or whatever they thought might sell at their own pace.  Possibly less than 6 hours of work a day. \\n This is one reason why, when industrialization came to both Europe and Japan, the result was dismal working conditions.  From a cultural background, as both regions had, that dictated when work was there to be done it would be done with great effort and long hours the fact that in factories there was  always  work to be done resulted in what we now see as abusive labor practices. \\n Working 12 or 16 hours a day to get the crops in before they are ruined by rain makes sense.  Working 12 to 16 hours a day in a factory because that\\'s how you\\'ve always worked doesn\\'t make nearly as much sense. \\n TL;DR: there was no such thing as a \"typical working week\".  Labor was burst labor and often involved 110+ hours of week when the burst was needed, and much less when there was no need for a burst. \\n EDIT: Soldiers, professional soldiers that is, may have had the closest thing to regular working hours that existed.   They trained on a set schedule, typically an hour or two daily, and then had various set duties (standing guard) that lasted a measured amount of time.   Of course during war they worked until they dropped.  Back to burst work again.... \\n',\n  0),\n ('Well the Umayyad takeover of Spain was in many ways more about opportunism rather than outright conquest. \\n Their forays into Spain could in many ways be seen as an extension of the Arab raiding of Anatolia (for prestige and booty), and only settlement over a longer span of time once the frontiers had moved past the old raiding areas and became stable for farmers to move in. \\n It just so happened to be the good luck (to the muslims) that the Visigoths had just survived a nasty civil war which had left an usurper as king with questionable legitimacy, with that king being killed in battle with the Arab and Berber army.  With King Roderic\\'s already shaky legitimacy, his death brought down the whole edifice of centralized resistance. \\n Keep in mind the Iberian peninsula, was already already prone to independence amongst its regions (take for example, the long survival of basque culture from even before Roman conquest) because of its particular geography.  The Muslim army offered good terms to many of the remaining Visigothic leadership, and many regional governors cut deals with the Arab leadership in exchange for autonomy. \\n It was only after more than a hundred years that Romano-Visigothic culture switched over to Islamic, for reasons similar to Egypt and the Levant: Islamic religion required conversion in order for people to participate in its politics.  Thus despite not being a forceful process, it was an attractive one nonetheless. \\n Why all this background on Visigothic-Umayyad Spain?  Because this was and would be the situation in France as well regarding Tours. \\n It\\'s interesting the precedents in Charles Martel\\'s era that are similar with the last king of Visigothic Spain.  You have a contested leadership conflict. You have autonomous outlying regions of the kingdom that the central leadership is trying to recentralize by force.  You have opportunistic raiding by the Arabs, that sometimes changes into occupation with a successful seizure of a fortified town.  In the event the Arabs can\\'t seize a key town, they call it a successful raid on the countryside and then go home. \\n So, supposing the Merovingians lose Tours.  What would happen? \\n In my opinion, given the precedents, much would depend upon the survival of Charles Martel personally, and to a lesser degree the Merovingian \"king\" Theuderic IV.  The death, be it physical or political, of Martel (like say a situation where he completely lost legitimacy by fleeing the battlefield like a coward), and say the subsequent capture of Theuderic would lead, much like in Visigothic Spain, to a collapse of centralized resistance.  Martel already had to expend a lot of energy reconquering fairly autonomous lands in his own core provinces in the 730s.  With him gone, those regional leaders might decide, like the Visigothic governors, to recognize Arab authority in exchange for autonomy. \\n Now, supposing Martel survives, loses the battle, but puts on a good show and keeps together a significant degree of his forces, then the particular concerns of supply chains come into play.  If Martel\\'s forces have lost but are intact, though he can\\'t face the Arab army in pitched battle, he can harass them while on friendly terrain, thus keeping the Arabs from simply walking into key towns/fortifications, or negotiating from a position of power with the controllers of those locations. \\n And likely what\\'ll happen, is the Arabs will declare victory, wander back to their home base, and continue raiding next year.  If an opportunity comes up again to defeat the forces of whoever the Frankish leader is again, they\\'ll likely take it and see where it goes.  Once again, opportunism, rather than outright conquest. \\n Keep in mind too, should Martel lose Tours, even if he keeps his forces together, he\\'s also lost a significant bit of his legitimacy, so the problems of autonomous former provinces pops its head up again.  But the difference would be, without the Arab army sticking around unopposed, it\\'ll be a Frankish cultural fight for autonomy, rather than local autonomy under Arab suzerainty. \\n tl;dr - Did the Umayyads have a reasonable hope of taking over Francia?  Sure.  But it wouldn\\'t be subjugation.  It would be voluntary opportunism on both sides, both of the desires of autonomy from local frankish aristocracy, and the success of arab armies in a pitched battle. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"Well in ancient Rome the three benefits of marriage were  property, citizenship, and children. If you consider children as a benefit in every ancient society then yes every ancient society did have a legal benefit. Property was a benefit to the married romans cause they would get to share a roof, the poorer person would rise in status how ever little it may be. This doesn't always work in some nomadic tribes because, well they're nomads for one. And the last benefit is citizenship.

Which is very centric on Mediterranean cultures. Idk about the rest of the world's cultures at the time. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"Continuing... \\n Despite their poor strategic situation, Japan was determined to fight on. The military was still convinced that a decisive battle (this time fought on land against invading Allied forces) would force the Allies to the negotiating table. At this point, the main focus of the negotiations shifted from a desire to hold Japanese possessions (although obviously it was hoped they could be kept) to a desire to maintain the existing government and power structure of Japan, mainly the position of the Emperor as head of the country. The Postdam Declaration, demanding Japan's unconditional surrender, only hardened Japanese resolve. \\n The Allies had already begun rounding up war criminals in Germany and had made no secret of the fact that they were going to do the same in Japan. Most of Japan's government and military, including the Emperor, were (deservedly) on the lists of war criminals. Not only did the military and the government (mostly the same thing) want to preserve their own power and lives, but they also had a real and definite loyalty to the emperor. It's difficult to describe how Japanese felt about the emperor, but it can perhaps be best summed up as some combination of the Pope, The President and how the British see their Queen. Japan was simply unwilling to surrender until the Emperor's safety at the very least, was assured. The Allies on the other hand, demanded Japan's UNCONDITIONAL surrender. \\n Now we can take a look at things from the Allied perspective. Before the Bomb was dropped, The Allies were looking at a long, expensive and bloody invasion of Japan. Japan could still muster millions of soldiers and they would be fighting from positions prepared months in advance on Home Territory. Any landing in Japan, the invasion plan was known as Operation Downfall, would have dwarfed D-Day in Europe. But for the Allies, the most dangerous part of the invasion was the expected fanatical resistance of the Japanese, Soldier and Civilian alike. \\n Japanese Soldiers fighting in the Pacific had a well-earned reputation for fighting almost to the last man. By the end of the Battle of Iwo Jima, only 300 Japanese survived out of a starting force of 23,000 to give on example. But more chilling still, were American experiences on Okinawa, the first battle fought on an island with a significant Japanese local population. More than 100,000 civilians died in the battle out of population of 300,000. Some civilians would charge American positions with bamboo spears or ancient rifles. Other Civilians were slaughtered by Americans who simply did not take the time to distinguish between Japanese forces hiding among civilians and the civilians themselves. Okinawa was also the site of numerous Civilian mass suicides, motivated by Japanese propaganda which spoke of the horrors of American Occupation. \\n So that's what the American experience was with Japanese resistance. Once again, a whole other post could be written about whether this perception was correct (It's controversial whether people in mainland Japan would have resisted so fanatically) but this was their perception and it motivated the dropping of the bomb. Operation Downfall was expected to be so bloody that 500,000 Purple Hearts were manufactured in advance, they're still haven't used all those Purple Heart's 70 years later. \\n So, the actual decision to drop the bomb and the bombing itself. Finally, we're here. The important thing to remember, and it often forgotten when discussing the bomb, is that the A-Bomb was not considered taboo when it was dropped, these perceptions came later with the Cold War and the threat of MAD. The Allied leadership did not know about the effects of radiation and they did not consider it in terms of ending the world. To them, it was just a really, REALLY BIG bomb, no different than the thousands of smaller bombs dropped on Japan except that it was impressive and maybe had the capability to force a Japanese surrender. I won't discuss the ethics of city carpet bombing here, although if you want I could talk about the strategic value of it, suffice to sat, it was an accepted tactic for the allies that they had been utilizing nearly the entire war against both Germany and Japan. Once the stigma of the Nuclear bomb is removed, it becomes quite simple for you to understand allied thinking at the time. Operation Downfall was looking like one of the bloodiest campaigns of all time for American and Japanese. The Japanese were unwilling to surrender however so the invasion looked necessary. But if the Allies revealed their super weapon and proceeded to annihilate Japan with it, the war would end sooner, cheaper and with probably fewer deaths once Japan was forced to accept their helplessness in the face of the bomb. \\n tl;dr: There was no moral justification necessary for the Allies, they were simply dropping a bomb just like any other they dropped except more powerful. They hoped to end the war sooner and prevent a long and bloody invasion of Japan by forcing a Japanese surrender. \\n A note before I end this post. Whether the bombs actually forced a Japanese surrender or not is a matter of some debate. Between the dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan and their are compelling arguments that this forced the Japanese surrender rather than the bombs. I'd be happy to talk more about this if you like, and their are also multiple threads in the FAQ about it. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('Yes. And from an historical perspective, there\\'s actually something a bit problematic about Tolkien\\'s views on rural England; it\\'s actually a very  unnatural  landscape! It\\'s a very beautiful one, don\\'t get me wrong, but the idyllic countryside he loved so much was the product of thousands of years of grubby human meddling, and not just a sudden victim of the Industrial Revolution. \\n There\\'s evidence of [widespread logging in England as early as the Bronze Age]( and what had been thick forest cover on the island probably dwindled to as little as 15% of its land area by the Conqueror\\'s time. Trees were chopped down for fuel, to build houses and ships, and to clear land for agriculture and pasture. The British Navy\\'s demand for lumber during the Napoleonic Wars subsequently brought it to as little as 4-5%, and it didn\\'t start recovering until the 20th century. At present, forest cover in England [is estimated at around 11-13%]( depending on whose numbers you\\'re using. \\n So the landscape that Tolkien admired -- the rolling hills, little streams, hedgerows, and stone walls -- is really pretty, but it\\'s more testament to thousands of years of human control than anything that could reasonably be called \"nature,\" much less \"wilderness.\" I mean, Jesus, some English hedge patterns date to the early Middle Ages, and there\\'s evidence it was being used to \"fence\" pasture and farmland during the Bronze Age as well. It\\'s one of the reasons that landscape archaeology in England is such a strong field, because humans have been meddling with the environment there unchecked for  thousands  of years after killing off the islands\\' apex predators and exterminating most of its game as well.

Once Truman left the White House, his only income was his old army pension: $112.56 per month. \\n He took out a personal loan from a Missouri bank shortly after leaving office, and then set about establishing another precedent for future former chief executives: a book deal for his memoirs of his time in office. Ulysses S. Grant had overcome similar financial issues with his own memoirs, but the book had been published posthumously, and he had declined to write about life in the White House in any detail. For the memoirs, Truman received only a flat payment of $670,000, and had to pay two-thirds of that in tax; he calculated he got $37,000 after he paid his assistants. \\n Truman was quoted in 1957 as saying to then-House Majority Leader John McCormack, \"Had it not been for the fact that I was able to sell some property that my brother, sister, and I inherited from our mother, I would practically be on relief, but with the sale of that property I am not financially embarrassed.\" \\n In 1958, Congress passed the Former Presidents Act, offering a $25,000 yearly pension to each former president, and it is likely that Truman\\'s financial status played a role in the law\\'s enactment.

Eventually NATO troops, under a new stabilization force called [KFOR]( entered Kosovo to ensure the ceasefire was maintained.

I read once that Pizarro, the conquistador that took Peru, executed the Inca king by force-baptizing him and then claiming he\\'s a heretic (since he was a christian who worshiped Inca idols) and executed him. I have no idea how true this story is but I doubt any native was likely to adopt the religion of the oppressor out of nothing other than it being forced down his throat. \\n HOWEVER, we need to consider two things when talking about the conversions. The first is the work of the Jesuits, the Papal order in charge of converting heathens. The Jesuits built a lot of churches on the fringes of the Spanish empire and even built villages called reductiones where they gathered natives under their guide as a sort of Kibbutz. These Jesuits provided the natives under their care with knowledge, learning, food, shelter and also religion, and I think that the success of conversions in Latin America can also be attributed to these willing converts who were taught by the Jesuits and became Christians not because it was forced upon them but because they were raised that way or accepted Christianity as a part of their new more educated persona. \\n The second thing we need to consider is the mixing of religions. There were Indians and Africans in America all living under Christian Spanish overlords, and it\\'s not uncommon to trace supposedly Christian celebrations or saints to native or African origins. The Virgin of Guadalupe, for example, contains traces of an earlier, Aztec goddess in her \"origin story\" and the way in which she is commemorated.

The shepherd's wife happens to have just given birth to a stillborn baby, so they swap babies and show Harpagus the stillborn baby as proof that they killed it, and keep the royal baby. \\n Fast forward a decade, and Astyages meets the boy and realizes that it's his grandson.  He decided to let him live because the dream interpreters convince him that because the boy had been made king in a children's game he was playing with the other youths, the prophesy had already been fulfilled and there was nothing to worry about.  However, he was pissed at Harpagus and invited him to dinner, where he cooked up Harpagus' own son and served it to him as a meal, asking him how he liked it. Harpagus said it was delicious, and then Astyages gave him the head, hands, and feet of his son in a basket and told him that he could eat it if he was still hungry.  Harpagus played it cool, bided his time, and started a rebellion and gave the kingdom to Astyages grandson who he had not killed as a baby, who happened to be Cyrus the great. \\n TL:DR  Median king secretly serves his aide's son to him as dinner, tells him after \\n\",\n  0),\n ('Hello! I was required to have two emphases for my B.A. in history. I settled on ancient and Asian, but an honors program eventually forced me to dedicate most of energies toward Greek and Roman historiography. On the other hand, I was always more interested in those poorly-understood \"barbarians\" (it still makes me upset how \"ancient history\" often means Greece and Rome). Carthage seemed especially fascinating given their role in the Punic Wars, and so I began reading every book I could find on the subject, at least in English; then I taught myself some French and German, which opened the door to all sorts of new scholarship; still not satisfied, I delved deeper into Carthage\\'s Phoenician background and ended up learning some Phoenician-Punic along the way. I\\'m currently working on my M.A. thesis, which examines relations between Tyre and Israel during the tenth century. This has allowed me to branch out into Biblical and Near Eastern history. \\n As for the Second Sino-Japanese War part, I grew up listening to stories about my grandparents\\' experiences during the conflict; one of my great-grandfathers was actually a [KMT general]( In addition, I\\'ve always lived close to Chinese-American communities and occasionally attend services at Chinese churches, where many of the older folks still remember the war. In my free time, I read what I can about the subject; I just finished Rana Mitter\\'s  Forgotten Ally , which was decent if a little too shallow for my tastes. \\n TL;DR; I\\'m really, really curious. :D \\n',\n  0),\n ('I\\'d say that explanation oversimplifies and possibly even reverses the order of some things. \\n During the revolution, Castro was adamant that he wasn\\'t a communist. And going into the revolution, it\\'s quite possible (even probable) that he wasn\\'t. Castro came from an upper-middle class family, was a lawyer, and actually ran in a Congressional race (in the opposition liberal party) for a brief period that Batista seemed to be liberalizing. \\n Afterward, Castro because disillusioned with the possibility of peaceful change in Cuba and led an attack on some barracks, for which he was arrested. In his time in jail, he gave his  History Will Absolve Me . \\n The US wasn\\'t adamantly opposed to Castro during the revolution, either. Different factions of the government supported either him or Batista, and the official response to the revolution while it was on going was muddled (I believe the rebels even received some provisions from the US, but can\\'t recall the details). The New York Times and other US papers had reporters \"embedded\" (for lack of a better term) with the rebels, and Castro was often seen as a rather dashing, romantic figure. At this point in time, he was focused on wooing the American public, so it\\'s possible that despite his personal communistic feelings he tailored his arguments to find a sympathetic American audience. \\n However, leading up to the success of the revolution, many Communists came to join in as well (most notably Che Guevara). The time spent in the impoverished Cuban countryside is also said to be something that moved Castro to embrace communism. So following the revolution, Castro began to appropriate and nationalize industries - BIG RED FLAG to the US. Castro\\'s rhetoric grew more Marxist as well, and this further led the US to distrust him. So eventually Castro reached out to the USSR, and the US began to turn toward counterrevolutionaries to get rid of Castro. \\n There should also be some discussion of the US\\'s long, complicated and quasi-(and not-so-quasi)imperialist relationship with Cuba, and how that would impact both American and Cuban impressions and decision-making, but this is pretty long as is. \\n TL;DR - Castro didn\\'t start out communist, but grew more sympathetic to the ideals and less trusting of the US over time, the US was skeptical of him as well, which is what led to the turn to the USSR. \\n',\n  0),\n ('The \"when\" is a bit tough as it was not an overnight change. Pikes were used in large number because throughout the Medieval Era and late Renaissance cavalry was, by all accounts, the leading power on the field. Even with massive pike formations cavalry could rule the day. Thus infantry was formed into tremendously deep squares of pikes mixed in with bowmen, swordsmen, crossbowmen, etc. to give it flexibility and, in the mid-late 17th century, supported directly on the front with light cannonry. \\n Also in the 17th century though came the rise of the gun, the matchlock musket. It was so incredibly heavy  it required a stand at all times to hold it up . Then you need to stick the rope into the hammer and blow on it gently to maintain its ember. Make sure you give it just the perfect amount of give or it won\\'t hit the flash pan right and won\\'t even fire! Then you open up the flashpan again and fire. This would lead to load times of, in perfect conditions, 45-60 seconds and in combat more. \\n So why were guns used at all and how were they used? Because they\\'re terrifying! These guns are  loud , stupidly loud. Far louder than any gun today or that you see in Hollywood action movies. They also produce a  lot  of smoke. A shit ton of smoke. Especially in the pre-Napoleonic era and even post war was, in many ways, far more concerned with morale than just straight up killing as many people as possible. It\\'s not killing a hundred of the enemy it\\'s about killing them all at the same time with a thunderous boom and a billow of smoke. Imagine being in some pike formation and you\\'re slow marching up to this enemy pike formation (can\\'t run too fast or they\\'ll counter charge and tear you apart) and your eardrums practically burst, you can\\'t see the enemy anymore from smoke, and half a dozen dudes right next to you all slump over.  That\\'s fucking terrifying . \\n So guns were integrated into pike formations. By the 30 Years\\' War (1618-1648) most pike formations would have a 1:1 ratio of musketmen and pikemen. Musketmen would run out, fire their shots, and retreat back into the pike formations for protection from cavalry and enemy infantry. \\n So why did this go away? A few simultaneous advancements happening at the tail end of the 17th century. The flintlock musket, for one, would come into the scene.  Much  simpler than its matchlock counterpart it did not require the complicated rope system of keeping an ember going nor was it so large and clumsy. It required a simple spark from a hammer in the flash pan. It also allowed standardized amounts of powder that came in \\'pouches\\' thus simplifying the reloading process. Men could now fire 3-4 rounds per minute consistently rather than 1 and at most 2 in best conditions. Add into that though the biggest of them all, the ring bayonet. The socket bayonet was one which stuck into the gun and thus literally turned a musket into a functional spear. The ring bayonet, however, went  around  the barrel and thus allowed the gun to be operational while also functioning as a 2-2.5 meter spear. This completely removed the necessity of pikes. Pikes were one dimensional weapons and required significant training for men to be cohesive with them. So were bows. They were all but defenseless against cavalry or infantry and thus needed protection from infantry. \\n Musketmen needed neither. They  were  both. They could bring hell upon the enemy from a distance with even more devastating morale effect than bow or crossbows while also protecting themselves from cavalry. [Form a square]( and you are nigh-impenetrable. Further it only takes about a week to train someone to use a gun and a month to teach them the necessary formations. It would take decades to teach someone to be a good bowman and months to train to work in a pike formation. \\n TL;DR: \\n Flintlock muskets made muskets very effective personal killing machines which could slaughter other non-musket armed infantry formations. With the ring bayonet they could, in addition to that, at least hold their ground against traditionally armed infantry. By combining the roles of a pikeman and a bowman/crossbowman and with the reduced costs of forming an army out of musketmen rather than heavily armored pikemen muskets just naturally took over the pike and the bow on the battlefield. It did both jobs well enough. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"Check out Adam Tooze's  Wages of Destruction , especially the earlier chapters on Nazi ideology and its adaptation and reshaping of the earlier Wiemar and Imperial political economy. Basically, the Nazis saw Germany placed in opposition to other strong-willed national competitors. The immediate competitor was seen in Great Britain, but it was never really treated as a long-term threat since, by the 1930s, one could see the US supplanting the collapsing empire. Strength of will and blood purity were the boons that the German people could rely on, but that would be expressed through economic production. \\n The German people were  not  in a position to compete with the growing industrial power of America, especially since the NSDAP inherited the collapsing agriculture of earlier German governments, but it was never about directly invading the US. There was an ideological transformation of the earlier Imperial and Weimar need to expand colonially. Imperial Germany was shut out of the global south and lost what it had in the first war, so seizing eastern Europe from the Russians was a means of expanding territorially  and  capturing a colonial population that home markets could export to (19th century imperialism 101) -- however, the Nazis just wanted the land to expand agriculturally and to grow a strong German population (necessary to compete with large populations like those in America and China, and to feed the industrial machine). That's Lebensraum. The later invasion of the Soviet Union was also an ideological necessity to crush socialism, and a material one: before the invasion of Poland, the leadership of the German military assessed oil reserves at around five years, and the only significantly developed oilfields in the world were in Texas and Baku. \\n So tldr, the Nazis weren't interested in invading America and seizing it. Nazi ideology saw a longer struggle involving those it saw as strong industrial nationalist competitors, chief among these the United States (but also others like China and Japan). The militarism inherent to Nazi policy would have meant war, absolutely, but we're talking about a global war after decades of cold war arms racing and rapid industrialization. The attacks during the war were aimed at short-term industrial and logistic disruption, including some speculation at bombing America itself that they were never in a position to entertain. \\n Like I said, this is in Tooze and he goes into it way better than I do. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"While my knowledge of the Turkish state and the development of secularism is largely limited to the post-Young Turk coup, I will do my best to answer this, as I studied Turkey a fair bit as part of my dissertation. \\n The secularisation movement had been building for a while prior to Ataturk, as Koliano states in his earlier post. However, it had come in drips and drabs, as a number of the reformers saw secularisation as a means for increasing the power of the state, rather than the long-term social development it had been in Western Europe. As a consequence, the reformers could just as easily switch back to using Islam as a political tool if it was more convenient for them. \\n The Young Turks of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) exemplified this. While they generally pursued a policy of secularisation and constitutionalism, they also were willing to use Islam as a facet of their drive towards rejuvenating the Ottoman Empire, leading to things such as Pan-Turanism (the uniting of Turkic peoples under the Ottoman banner), the 'Army of Islam' led by Enver Pasha at the end of WWI which attempted to accomplish the aforementioned Pan-turanism, the call of Sultan Mehmed V for Muslims to pursue Jihad against the Allies in WWI and the attempted genocide of the Armenians and other Christians within the Empire. \\n Mustafa Kemal 'Ataturk' and the Kemalists of the Republican People's Party (RPP) established Turkey's independence in the aftermath of WWI and ruled it for the over 2 decades. They dropped the Islamist tendencies of the CUP and went all out on secularising Turkish society (the last Caliph was removed in 1922 by the RPP). But make no mistake here, contrary to what Kemalists will tell you, Ataturk ruled Turkey as a dictator of a one-party state. As a consequence, secularisation was overwhelmingly imposed from the top-down and was massively unpopular. This was for a couple of reasons. Firstly, Islam really formed the basis for popular cultural identity and societal cohesion outside of the major cities (where the RPP's power base was located) in the countryside, so when this was removed it was understandably viewed unfavorably. The second point is tied in with the first, which is that the RPP attempted to replace Islam with Kemalism as the unifying ideology for society...and failed miserably, as the government was not well-liked by the rural populace. This means that secularism can possess underlying authoritarian themes in Turkish politics. \\n What this means is that Turkey hasn't really properly become secularist- after all, the present government is Islamist- and remains deeply divided over the issue, as was seen in the unrest in 2013. \\n TL;DR: While the Turkish government is at least partly secularised, Turkish society as a whole can hardly be considered a 'bedrock' of secularism, largely due to clumsy attempts to implement it in the past. \\n Sources:\\n Turkey: A Modern History , Erik Zurcher. \\n I don't have any more to hand right now, but I can find their names if necessary. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('The Dutch East India Company was massively powerful. The VOC, or Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie, held a monopoly on the trade of many spices and a monopoly on dutch trade between the Cape of Good Hope to the Straits of Magellan. In fact, It sent more europeans to Asia than any of the other great mercantilist trading company. It even payed an  (edit: averaged) 18% dividend each year for almost 200 years (1). At its height it was wildly powerful, as with the other trading companies. These companies acted more like states than like companies in many aspects. The VOC commanded a fleet of 5000 ships (1). and ten thousand troops (2) at its peak. It held land from South Africa to Indonesia and was hegemonic in Asian waters in the 17th Century . The company collapsed because of corruption and ramifications of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, which was a part of the American Revolution, although the company wouldn\\'t be nationalized until 1796 after the occupation of the Netherlands. However the company\\'s demise in the 18th century was primarily due to cheap sugar from Brazil supplanting Indonesian sugar, along with the loss of its Malabar factories in 1741 and  Ceylon in 1796. The loss of naval supremacy in maritime Asia also greatly hurt the company, as the Anglo-Dutch wars saw the seizure of many goods inflicting major losses on the company(3). The company also was squeezed out of many markets as the Dutch lost influence over the course of the 18th century, resulting in the loss of trade in india on the Coromandel Coast and the Malabar Coast (4). Adding to its problems was the growing might of the British East India company and The French East India company. Both were backed by powerful navies and armies, and by the end of the 18th Century, most of India was under the BEIC control. \\nTl;DR Very Powerful \\n Citations \\n \\n Taylor, Bryan. \"The Rise And Fall Of The Largest Corporation In History.\" Business Insider.

One of the common misconceptions is that the average German fighter pilot in 1944 had a lot of experience.  The opposite was more true.  Apart from a few high scoring aces, the average fighter pilot was very inexperienced.  This comes down to the Luftwaffe's policy of flying pilots until they died.  This led to pilots cracking from the stress of combat and getting killed due to stress and fatigue. \\n Inexperienced pilots against experienced pilots usually didn't end well for the less experienced pilot.  This was shown by the survival rates for RAF pilots during the Battle of Britain: The younger pilots just out of flight school usually only had about 10 hours of experience of the aircraft that they would fight in.  -This reflected the fact that those young men had life expectencies in dogfights that could be counted in seconds, whereas the German pilots at the time were much more experienced and it showed in their kill tallies.  -For the Luftwaffe, the biggest problem they faced was returning to France in a damaged aircraft. \\n By the time that you get to 1944, the Allies (RAF and USAAF) had experienced and well trained fighter pilots flying sweeps over occupied France to get operational experience, as well as escort missions.  This allowed the RAF and USAAF to go on a campaign to destroy the manpower of the Luftwaffe from 1943 onwards.  By the time that it got to D-Day, the average Luftwaffe pilot wasn't very experienced and didn't know how to handle his aircraft, making it less likely that he would survive more than a few weeks of operations before he was killed or injured so seriously that he was incapable of flying. \\n Add in the fact that the German industrial output of petroleum was critically low, by the time that D-day came, the Luftwaffe was struggling to have enough fuel to put aircraft in the air. \\n So, to put a blunt answer onto your question, no it was not the Mustang that was the stand-out and pivotal aircraft of the European Air War, it was a number of aircraft, ranging from fighters to bombers to multi-role aircraft that made the difference. \\n The mustang had a big influence, but it filled a gap, like the Hurricane filled a gap in the Battle of Britain, and the Wellington filled the gap until the Lancasters and Halifaxes started to see operational use. \\n TL;DR: A number of aircraft made important and profound impacts on the war in the air, and to single out a single aircraft as being the one would be impossible. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\">Simple question \\n Oh how wrong you are. This is an extremely complicated question. I don't have much time at the moment, but I would point towards the fact that the Constitution was very nearly not ratified in most of the big states that a centralized government was very much not desirable for many of the states, you had powerful politicians such as Patrick Henry basically saying fuck everyone else Virginia is doing fine and can do fine on its own. In addition Rhode Island initially had no intention of ratifying the Constitution and it was only after extreme economic pressure from the other States and the fear that various towns would leave the state that they reluctantly came on board. Fast forward to the Presidency of John Adams and you have the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions regarding the Alien and Sedition acts which essentially asserted that the States had the right to nullify Federal law ( that's going to come back to bite Madison in 1828), Hamilton discussed using Federal troops, but ultimately it was decided not to. Then the election of 1800 came around, and the federalists tried to deny the election to Jefferson. The Governors of Virginia and Pennsylvania both formulated plans to raise their respective militias and march on Washington if it appeared the Federalists would deny it, ultimately it only got as far as building new arsenals and setting up a rider system to rapidly convey news between the two. Around the same time you have the Spanish trying to setup states in the west and recruiting Americans for the purpose ( and primary source Documents indicate many Kentuckians were willing to switch over). During the war of 1812 the New England states were extremely upset with the war, it interrupted their trade, and Madison/Jefferson had passed the embargo acts which devastated their economies. At the Hartford convention some radicals attempted to bring the notion to secede to the floor( and I would add James Monroe was preparing to ignore habeas corpus and arrest them).

Also have listed below paraphrased text from Jared Diamond\\'s \"Guns, Germs & Steel\" which have some interesting points to add to the debate. \\n Bow and arrows weren\\'t the only technology that didn\\'t develop in native Australian populations despite their lengthy time frame. Metal tools, writing, complex societies were all other missing items found in most other civilisations in one form or another. Aborigines remained hunter-gathers in an arid & infertile land that limited its hunter-gatherer population to only a few hundred thousand people. Compared with other civilisations and societies that lived in denser, closer contact with eachother and had more numerous populations of people; that meant Australia had far fewer potential inventors, far fewer societies to experiment with adopting innovations, and less contact between hunter-gather societies. \\n Some apparent regional regressions of technology in Australia may stem from the isolation and relatively few inhabitants of its population centres. The boomerang, the quintessential Australian weapon, was abandoned in the Cape York Peninsula of north-eastern Australia, where it has a denser, rainforest environment.\\nThe function of the small stone points that appear in Australian archaeological sites around 5,000 years ago remains uncertain: while an easy explanation is that they may have been used as spear points & barbs, they are suspiciously similar to the stone points and barbs use on arrows elsewhere in the world. If they really were so used, the mystery of bows & arrows being present in modern New Guinea but absent in Australia might be compounded:  perhaps  bows & arrows actually were adopted for awhile then abandoned, across the Australian continent. The resistance to New Guinea influence is astonishing. Across the island dotted, narrow ribbon of water known as the Torres Straight, New Guinea farmers had pigs, pottery, bows & arrows and faced Australian hunter-gathers who lacked the same. \\nThere is also no evidence of any new technology or introduction reaching Australia from Indonesia after Australia\\'s initial colonisation 40,000 years ago, until the dingo arrived around 1,500BC.\\n-Paraphrased from \"Guns, Germ & Steel\". \\n TL:DR - Huge continent, small population, lack of arable land, lack of regular contact between hunter-gather societies was a recipe that not only precluded the invention of the bow & arrow, but many other inventions & technologies. \\n',\n  0),\n ('I am putting my military scientist hat on as well as my military historian\\'s hat. This post starts with... well, I have to clarify some stuff, because what you\\'re asking is complicated. \\n Firstly, and I want this to be crystal clear,  THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AN INHERENTLY \\'SUPERIOR\\' WEAPON . Please take no offense when I say this - the bolding is more to relieve my own emotion and frustration at the idea of something that is \"always\" more apt. The Germans have a donkey corps for their rugged mountains. Arrows had both a higher rate of fire and greater capacity to kill right up until the 18th century, in comparison to firearms. But I am getting ahead of myself. \\n War is fought by human beings, yes? War isn\\'t about technology. It\\'s about breaking your opponent\\'s willingness to fight. I feel like I should say that as well - just because you\\'ve got a predator drone and the other guy\\'s got a camel, doesn\\'t mean you\\'re going to win. It\\'s not over until  they  decide to give up, and do as you will. \\n And human beings fight in context: ie, human beings will arm and armor themselves to  beat their enemy.  Why do you think in modern asymmetric warfare people blend into their OWN population, and use cheap and nasty IEDs? Because that is  fucking effective . It is effective even against more \"sophisticated\" (read; expensive) equipment and training. And in the end it  doesn\\'t matter , because if the enemy simply doesn\\'t give up, then that enemy can\\'t lose until every single one of them is dead. ((That\\'s not victory, by the way - that is an admission by the \"victor\" that they couldn\\'t win.)) \\n What is \"effective\" on the battlefield then will be entirely contextual. Warfare is about your opponent - not you. You need to find the linchpin of their resistance - the Centre of Gravity - the point to which if you apply pressure then your opponent will crack. Technology is just a means to an end, and if you rely on it to BE your entire plan then you\\'re fighting shitty war. Killing people should be a side-effect of war, not the bloody aim. \\n Anyway, what I am saying as well is that vastly \"superior\" technology normally only lasts a learning curve. Do you get what I am saying? When I was in the army I had a LAVIII train a high-tech infra-red sensor on me. I hid in a ditch up to my neck in muddy water until it decided no one was there. You adapt your tactics, operations, and strategy until it is no longer \"superior\" - just inconvenient to the way that YOU are now doing war. \\n That is why the genius of the General is important - he uses \"fighting against other people\" to his advantage. He plays mental games. He tricks and traps. He makes the most of the weapons he has and hopefully understands. Even today, it is all about context. \\n Why do some technologies become more common and effective then? Well - people get more experience at using them in different contexts, and build up a body of knowledge at how to minimise the weaknesses of things. Why did gunpowder become popular? Because firearms were cheap at the price: any peasant could fire one, but it took years and good money to make an archer. The noise and smoke made an impression as well, above and beyond simply killing. After a while people improved on that gunpowder until it had things which made it effective in a multitude of contexts. Effective depends on context. \\n TL:DR There is no such thing as an inherently superior weapon. Only dangerous people, carrying weapons that are apt in context. \\n And yes - I know this answer is unsatisfying. No doubt people will chime in and tell me that I am wrong, that clearly the machine gun is \"superior\" to a flintlock.

This is as logical and simple a concept as you can imagine.  It\\'s  easier  to communicate with the people you need to communicate with, and there\\'s a reason people use that path, well, for communication, so typically speaking you\\'re going to see battles take place around areas that are easy and routinely traveled.  Not necessarily  on  those sites, but around them.  Armies  can  march through rough, rugged, shithole terrain (see Hannibal\\'s march through the swamps to avoid engaging the Roman army, Alexander, B. (1993)  How Great Generals Win  p.41) but typically speaking this was dangerous, as seen when Hannibal lost a number of his men by risking those very same swamps.  So typically, an army wants to use roads, rail, paths, trails, whatever guarantees their destination and ultimately makes life easier to keep a cohesive unit. \\n So you\\'d have two armies doing their best to try to navigate terrain where they aren\\'t terribly hard to see, and truth be told, armies leave a lot of mess behind, so properly trained scouts have a decent fix on  where  the enemy is roughly.  Be this by spying an enemy marching down the road with your own eyes, or conferring logical information (a burned up, abandoned camp, discarded shells, tracks from the army, locals giving you information, horse shit, there are a thousand ways) scouts usually had a decent idea of where abouts an army was, if not necessarily where it was going. \\n So now we have logically dictated normal paths of armies, so how does this translate into two armies meeting and fighting one another?  Typically speaking, a battle itself is not the ultimate goal of either commander, and can often times translate into one of the two commander\\'s failures (not always, but sometimes).  When a general, king, commander, what have you, is marching his army, it\\'s to fulfill a set purpose. \\n So we\\'ll use a simple, theoretically example plucked from my ass. \\n You have Gaius here, a legate fighting in Syria.  His goal is not to go pick fights with local Syrians and then march around proudly because he killed 10,000 Syrians (he\\'d brag about that, but that wasn\\'t his goal), the legate is trying to reach a strategic objective.  In this theoretical situation we\\'ll say he\\'s trying to take the Seleucid city of Totallynotmadeupia.  Why does he want Totallynotmadeupia?  Because it is the political center of the current resistance, it has enough plunder to gratify his troops if it comes down to a brutal assault and that always looks good for Rome, but most important it\\'s the central hub of where the Seleucid commanders are organizing their efforts.  Grain, money, raw materials, weapons, and troop junctions all meet here in Totallynotmadeupia, so he has to go and take this city from the enemy, depriving them of all of the above. \\n Therefore, he will march towards it.  Now given everything discussed, the Seleucids obviously don\\'t want to lose Totallynotmadeupia, so they send out one of their armies which they are confident can defeat Gaius in battle.  The goal here is that Gaius does not reach Totallynotmadeupia (heretofore referred to as Upia) with a sufficient force that he can take the city. \\n So now the Seleucid commander, we\\'ll name him Nektos for fun, marches out with his army.  His scouts tell him that Gaius has 10,000 legionaries, 2,000 auxiliaries (mostly foreign cavalry), and is roughly 8 days from Upia at his current pace.  Scouts also report that Gaius is relying heavily on foraging because he\\'s wandered away from an important supply train, hoping to catch the Seleucids unawares. \\n So Nektos now knows roughly where Gaius is, and Gaius gets a decent idea of where Nektos is, knowing that Nektos is coming out with a mixed force of mercenaries and hoplites that number about 15,000 strong.  Their scouts are keeping tabs on each other consistently and they\\'re gravitating towards one another.  Gaius knows he can\\'t take Upia if that means Nektos will be at his back so he  must  fight Nektos. \\n But he has to be ready for Nektos.  Gaius remembers very well the Battle of Teutoberg Wald and he knows full well what\\'ll happen if his men are hit while marching in a column.  He also remembers Crassus and how he did his best to get his men out of marching order and into battle arrangements, but it still fell on its ass, and Gaius is not a huge fan of drinking gold.  So he has scouts constantly keeping tabs on Nektos while he dances around keeping an eye out for terrain. \\n Eventually Nektos and Gaius get close enough to each other that its a simple brisk march to reach one another.  This where both armies need to do their best to pick a battlefield.  Sun Tzu stresses heavily how important it is to pick a battlefield for yourself. \\n What Gaius wants is a place with plenty of hills to help break up Nektos\\'s hoplites, but that\\'s a problem because that would hurt his cavalry, but it\\'s still better than a perfect setting hoplite fight.  Just as important, however, his reliance on foraging means he can\\'t be that picky. \\n He hears Nektos is camping out near some hills, so he decides this isn\\'t the  ideal  setting, but given that he\\'s not going to be able to sustain this dance for much longer, he needs to take what he can get.  So he rallies his men and begins the march, once again, scouts forward and in front. \\n Nektos\\'s scouts notice that Gaius is marching at him.  He can\\'t stay bedded, he can\\'t march, because doing so means that his opponent will overrun him when he\\'s not in battle formation.  He doesn\\'t mind the terrain he\\'s on, so rather than risk getting caught by a night time forced march, he gets his army ready, draws up battle plans, and prepares for the coming battle, scouts constantly letting either army know where each other are. \\n Finally Nektos and Gaius meet on the field of battle, dictated by the circumstances of their mutual objectives.  They fight, Gaius beats Nektos, but sustains heavy losses, and realizes that although Nektos\\'s army ran from the battlefield, it was too even, and there is no hope of taking Upia with the army he has.  Therefore, he turns and leaves, marching out of Syria and hoping the Senate isn\\'t too angry at him as he replenishes his army. \\n This is a very basic example of all the things that go into play when two armies decide they\\'re going to fight each other.  It\\'s not a case of \"MEET ME AT AGINCOURT AT DAWN, YOU FRENCH SWINE!\", the circumstances dictated that both kings were going to fight there, because Henry V couldn\\'t run any further, and this was the best location he could hope to fight the French on. \\n Many times, you\\'ll see commanders simply say fuck it, I don\\'t want to fight you there, and walk off, shielding their backs.  The worst generals are the ones that see an opponent stop and just decide well fuck it, lets fight. \\n [Consul Fabius]( had learned from Cannae and Lake Tresamene that you probably don\\'t want to just attack Hannibal when Hannibal wants to be attacked.  So he danced around and avoided battle, despite Hannibal desperately trying to goad him into one. \\n Then Scipio marched on Spain and cut off the Carthaginian land route to Rome.  This is a great example of \"you don\\'t have to fight if you don\\'t want to...unless you REALLY have to\". \\n It was always dangerous, as mentioned in the Upia scenario, to march  Around  your enemy to your objective, because once again the opposing general had a decent idea of where you are, and marching does not involve walking in battle formation.  It\\'s usually long, battle-inefficient columns and parades where a lot of people may not even have the proper access to the things they need to go start a fight with someone.  (Could someone correct me, I don\\'t believe Roman legionaries marched  with  their  pila , but retrieved them before the battle). \\n So to summarize: \\n -Efficient commanders know where each other are \\n -Efficient commanders are trying to secure an objective that isn\\'t necessarily the battle itself. \\n -Commanders therefore dance with one another until one picks a spot to plop down. \\n -Urgency of the objective dictates whether or not a fight happens. \\n TL;DR \\n C\\'mon read the Upia story, it\\'s awesome. \\n Sources include a library on ancient and medieval warfare that I own, I could cite them all individually if you wish. \\n EDIT:  One final thing to add.  These concepts are pretty much universally true to warfare.  War itself has changed enormously throughout human history, but the concepts of how to achieve victory never have.  You always need supplies, a clear objective, and to secure that objective.  Even modern wars are waged in the same way, it\\'s the  conditions  and the norms of each time period that change. \\n So there are tons of specifics that people can add.  Yes, there have been instances of two commanders meeting up and going \"So you want to take this to that field over there and get this shit done?\" but that doesn\\'t change the basic concepts of how or why it happens.  Each era\\'s method of handling or reaching these generalities fascinates me. \\n',\n  0),\n (\">My biggest question is whether Israel attacked Syria, Jordan and Egypt based on the Arabs massing troops on the boarder or if the Arab powers had already planned to launch an attack and Israel was aware of this. \\n That's not an either-or.  Israel attacked when troops were massing precisely because it was fairly obvious an attack was imminent. \\n You can see stuff [here]( including reference by Nasser to an impending war in which the objective would be the destruction of Israel.  Egypt kicked the UN out of the Sinai a couple weeks prior to the beginning of war, and Iraqi troops began mobilizing in Jordan. \\n Israel's knowledge of an impending attack wasn't really intelligence, but was kinda assumed by all parties.  They had enough lead-up time to form a War Coalition (essentially the broadest possible coalition in parliament with a war-prepped cabinet), dig an absurd number of graves, and dig trenches and fortify border towns.  The decision to attack first was mostly tactical.  They were able to destroy nearly the entire Egyptian air force at first strike, giving air superiority on the Southern front for the duration of the war.  The Arab countries had a numerical advantage, but striking first and achieving air superiority pretty effectively negated that. \\n That's only the case with Egypt though.  With Jordan, the Israelis and Jordanians exchanged small-arms fire early on.  But that happened pretty frequently.  The first actual serious war-stuff began when Jordan shelled Jerusalem, which began the Jordanian front.  IIRC the deal is somewhat similar with Syria.  After war with Egypt began the Syrians started more heavily shelling the Galilee, though that may've been after an Israeli attack on airfields, like in Egypt. \\n It's important to note that there were cease-fires in place, but the countries were still technically at war.  Though there wasn't active heavy fighting, there were pretty frequent skirmishes with Syria and Jordan.  Syria would pretty frequently shell/fire on people near the border from their high-ground positions, and Palestinians living in Jordan would often attack Israel, which sometimes led to direct Israel-Jordan fighting.  Perhaps the most important was [this incident in 1965]( \\n Here are some decent wikipedias: \\n In the interest of brevity I won't link all the links on those, but some of them have useful information and sources. \\n tl;dr Israel fired first on the Egyptian front, when Egypt had kicked the UN out of the Sinai and was mobilizing its troops, while publicly saying war was coming.  Jordan and Syria were pretty much areas of constant conflict, but the real war was probably started first by Jordan. \\n Your fundamental question is if war was preventable.  Israel could've not attacked.  The question is what would've happened if they hadn't.  It's possible Egypt would've backed down, and if that'd happened Jordan and Syria would've almost certainly followed suit.  But Israel simply couldn't afford to take that risk.  Israel is very small, and the Egyptian advance wouldn't've had far to go if allowed to get all the way to the border.  Israeli leadership also seriously feared Egyptian bombing, which could've seriously hurt the country.  After Egyptian mobilization, war was fairly inevitable.  Israel just couldn't afford to wait for Egypt to back down, and war with Jordan and Syria followed as well. \\n I have a question for people who might now.  If Israel had lost, what would've happened?  Who would've gotten the land?  Would Israelis be killed, deported, or a minority?  Did the Arab countries make any plans with this, or did they not plan that far? \\n\",\n  0),\n ('This question is fairly vague. OP doesn’t really identify what constitutes ‘reverence’ and what constitutes ‘looking down upon’. So, that’s a problem to start with. I’m going to take a guess (one supported by some of the comments already posted) and assume that because the Maori language is taught and used officially, and because Maori customs (such as the Hakka) have been incorporated into the culture of mainstream New Zealand, that this, at least in part, to OP constitutes ‘reverence’ for Maori culture. \\n So, why doesn’t Australia make the Aboriginal Language official along with English? The answer is: Which particular Aboriginal language do you mean? There were in fact over 250 languages and dialects at the time of European colonisation of Australia. Of these, over 100 are still spoken. These languages come from at least two separate language families and although they share some common features and vocab, they can rightfully be considered distinct from each other.  So which one (or two, or three, or..) should be picked to be nationally revered? I’m not asking this question sarcastically. I think it is a legitimate question though one that is difficult to answer. \\n The situation is similar when it comes to cultural traditions, which particular group’s traditions are to be nationally revered? Some Aboriginal traditions and beliefs are shared across the continent and can therefore be celebrated nationally but much of Aboriginal culture consists of practices and beliefs that are specific to relatively small geographic areas. How can these be properly revered on the national level in a manner similar to the way that Maori traditions are revered in NZ? Those Aboriginal beliefs and traditions that are (generally) shared across the Australian continent (e.g. The Dreamtime/Dreaming, connection to the land, and the very complicated particulars of Aboriginal family connections and relationships) are in fact revered by Australia in primary and secondary school education and in public. \\n The level at which reverence for Aboriginal culture is most easily seen is the local level. It is not at all uncommon to have the ‘local’ Aboriginal people recognised officially and celebrated (for example, the Bundjalung People in my area). If you have ever been to a public speech at a university, church, or community hall in Australia you might have heard the speaker commence by “acknowledging the traditional owners of the land, the [insert group name here] people”. They don’t acknowledge the “Aboriginal People”, they acknowledge the local aboriginal group (e.g. the Bundjalung People). This is perhaps why it might seem that Australia as a whole does not revere Aboriginal culture. \\n (I am, of course, not including Torres Strait Islanders and Tasmanian Aborigines here in my answer. My point that Aboriginal culture is more disparate and internally diverse than Maori culture can simply be extended to include the fact The indigenous peoples of Australia include not only the many different peoples making up the Australian Aborigines but also include those that make up the Torres Strait Islanders and the Tasmanian Aborigines.) \\n *I might just add that I don’t in any way seek to deny that there is a long way to go for meaningful reconciliation. Neither do I wish to suggest that every single person in Australia reveres Aboriginal culture which is sadly not the case. \\n Sources on Aboriginal Languages and Maori: \\n Dalby, Andrew (1998). Dictionary of Languages. Bloomsbury Publishing plc \\n TL;DR: It might just seem like this because the cultures and languages of Aborigines are much more disparate and internally diverse than those of the Maori’s and are therefore more difficult to ‘revere’ on a national level. \\n',\n  0),\n ('It is a good question.

I\\'m not at all expert in this so I hesitate to be so dismissive, but this strikes me as an obvious propaganda rumor lacking both evidence and fundamental plausibility, and so I won\\'t address it further. \\n Kim Il-Sung was a mid-level commander in anti-Japanese resistance forces that operated across the Manchurian border in the 1930s. This resistance was not a major force in Korean life and ordinary Koreans were surely not well-informed about its activity. However, in the fishpond of Korean exile guerillas in Manchuria, he was a significant figure. \\n In a broad strategic sense nothing he did was very important, but in a personal sense he appears to have been a genuinely capable and successful military leader. His high-water mark was a raid on a place called Pochonbo in 1937. \\n By 1940 the Japanese had cracked down heavily and Kim was forced to rebuild his political career as a fraternal socialist comrade in Russia. It was his success in this role that led to him being appointed as head of their provisional government in the North, after which you know the story. \\n TL;DR  Kim Il-Sung was a significant figure in the Korean resistance, but the Korean resistance was not a significant presence in Korean life.

I suspect everyone reacting so badly might think you mean the \"bad guys\" n an absolute sense; that there is some kind of moral right and moral wrong which the warring powers fit neatly into. As /u/Warluster so articulately pointed out, which side you believed – believe – to be the “bad guys” of World War One largely depends on your point of origin. The British railed against the Hun. The Germans stamped “Gott Strafe England” on everything they could find. The Russians fought by turns the Austrians, the Germans, and then their own selves. In this sense, everyone is the “bad guy” and nobody. \\n But there is another element to the question, which I suspect has gotten lost in the general crowd. My flair reads “public perceptions of war”, and this involves studying people\\'s shared memory of an event. Who do we consider the “bad guy”  now ? After all, we\\'ve had nearly one hundred years to make a  narrative out of the conflict. ((I should explain; to make sense of an event, people turn their recollection, or groups of recollections, into a story or a “narrative”. A story is easy to understand and re-tell to others; it often has a main “point” and collects meanings around itself. This story changes over time with the needs of the audience.)) We have a strong, powerfully meaningful narrative about the Great War. Surely there are some “bad guys” in that? \\n I shall stick to the British narrative, as it is slightly easier. There won\\'t be any surprises, either; if you know anything about the First World War, you\\'ll have run across these tropes almost as a matter of course.  Please also bear in mind that these tropes are not true or false, nor am I making an argument that they are.  I am simply writing down certain things the general public often associates with the Great War. \\n Probably the most obvious “bad guys” in British canon are their own generals. “Lions led by donkeys” is a popular phrase for this. That caricature General, sitting one hundred miles behind the lines in a French chateau, planning by the lines on a map and slaughtering thousands of men. This is hardly fair (especially Brigadier Generals, per captia, had a higher death-rate than the infantry) but does it matter? This idea of the stay-behind General is a powerful expression of peoples\\' feelings of grief, tragedy, and waste. It was reinforced by the average soldier being literate in a way that troopers had not been before, writing home frequently, and making sense of their own experiences without it being mediated through official histories. “Lions led by donkeys” is born from that mass. \\n What about mud? Can mud be considered an enemy? ELM Burns wrote a book titled “General Mud”, implying that the mud was both everywhere, and an active combatant in some sort of war by nature. When we speak of the Great War, mud comes up so frequently I am often surprised at how easily people ignore it. The pictures we see are all of that moon-scape, horses up to their bellies in mud, shell-holes filled with water, men straining to drag some needed supply through to the front. This is all perfectly accurate, of course, as mud was a defining feature of the Western Front. There were other fronts, of course, which no one remembers. So can the way we think about the mud of the First World War, in that we pit it against “our” soldiers as they endure it like they endure their “real” enemy – does that make it the “bad guy”? \\n There are lots of these; the mythic canon of the Great War abounds with them. They shift and change as well – there is a current trend towards rehabilitating the reputation of Haig (the chief General of the British Forces post 1916), for example. I just realised how long my post had gotten, and thought I\\'d call it quits. But this is a really interesting question, because it is subjective.

Otherwise, probably not. \\n Same goes for the middle ages up until roughly the end of the 13th century and later where swords became more and more common.

Even more so amongst young adults. And on the topic of the number of swords themselves, well there\\'s this little interesting bit of trivia. Some fencing schools were associated with universities and most universities kept inventories of their students possessions. Many of them actually had swords. But the interesting part is this. Everything that was noted down as a student\\'s possession also had it\\'s value noted down and funnily enough, most swords were not that expensives. Their sheats were actually more expensive than the swords themselves. Now, this is only according to those particular documents and you have to take into account that those words were not made to be work of arts. They were made to be functionnal and that\\'s about it. \\n But that\\'s not all, many royal french army ordinances from the 15th century talk about swords and they seem to be a very common item required by soldiers. Whether they be professionnal soldiers or free archers (francs-archers in french... basically a form of militia if you will). \\n So, did everyone and their mothers own swords like they show in movies? Definitely not. Was it reserved to only a small part of the population? Well... that can\\'t be answered by a simple yes or no.

But that question cannot be answered by a simple yes or no simply because the middle ages last about 1000 years and things changed a LOT during that thousand of years. \\n Now, I don\\'t have all my sources on hand because they were documents showed to me years ago, but if needed I can try to dig up as many of them as I can.

Occasionally, Armenians would resort to armed resistance against government officials and Kurds who were seizing their property.  One such event captured international attention at the time:  \"A certain Kurdish chieftain, one  Moussa Bey , burned Armenian villages, waylaid and robbed merchants and carried away young girls.

In 1895 and 1896 between 63,000 and 100,000 Armenians were killed in those regions.  In 1896 the Sultan ordered the murder of 8000 Armenians in Constantinople. \\n After a few years of internal political turmoil, revolution, and counter-revolution Sultan Abdul Hamid was exiled, and The  Committee of Union and Progress, also known as The Young Turks , became the ruling party of the Ottoman Empire.

Upon solidifying power in 1909, the Young Turks ordered massacres at Adana and parts of Cilicia during which 30,000 Armenians were killed. \\n After entering World War I in 1914, the CUP decided to exterminate the entire Armenian population in Turkey.  On April 24, 1915, Talaat Pasha ordered the “arrest and deportation of the intellectuals of Constantinople and their subsequent murder in a remote area. Then followed the systematic massacres in towns and villages of all young and able-bodied Armenians.” (Kurkjian 298)  Over the next several months, an estimated 1 million-1.5 million Armenians perished during mass deportations into the Syrian Desert. \\n Kurkjian, V.

In most contemporary Western cultures, religion is not all-encompassing. If you're asked to describe yourself, your religion isn't necessarily the first thing to comes to mind. \\n However, in the 19th century, when Marx was writing, religion played a much larger role in peoples' lives. Religions bound people together and tore people apart in 19th century Europe. In the UK, for example, some were poor and some were rich, but everyone was an Anglican, which gave people a sense of unity. Meanwhile, over in Ireland, everyone was a Catholic, which to many Brits gave them a good reason to rule Ireland. Now, to a contemporary viewer, these might have just seemed to be the effects of nationalism, but Marx didn't see it that way. \\n To Marx, history and everything in history was all about who held power, and to him, religion was just another way that the Bourgeoisie could oppress the Proletariat. For instance, when Marx saw all people of all classes participating in a common religion, he viewed it as a trick by the rich to pacify the working class with false promises of a better life after death. In this way, religion reinforced the status quo by fooling the poor into doing whatever the rich wanted. \\n Meanwhile, Marx also saw religion as an imperialist force. I mentioned earlier that European powers often used their religion as an excuse to colonize foreign lands. Well Marx saw this as another move by the rich to gain more economic resources to increase profits. Meanwhile, the colonies would suffer increasing poverty under the rule of European powers and the Bourgeoisie would get ever richer. \\n So, in short, Marx saw religion as a tool used by the rich to take advantage of the poor by fooling them into thinking that the afterlife would make up for their mortal suffering. Meanwhile, he also believed that the elite used religion as an excuse to colonize and exploit foreign nations for personal benefit. And therefore, he thought that the only solution to religions exploitative nature was to abolish it entirely and start an atheistic communist society. \\n TL;DR: Opium of the masses, excuse for imperialism. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"I don't think anyone is asserting that the Venetians are idiots, as you say.  I think the arguments being put forward are simply that the existing trade routes were centuries old and well known; compared to new routes the existing routes were a safe commercial bet.  The time was prior to the Industrial Revolution and thus the widespread cultural notion of inevitable technological progression: they did not expect that ship design and navigation would improve so far so fast.  The idea that Portugal could sail around Africa was easy to believe; the idea that they could do so inexpensively, reliably, and in sufficient volume to obviate the Venetian routes was more far-fetched. \\n tl;dr: The Venetians probably thought that Portugal could open another trade route that would supplement, rather than replace, the Venetian routes. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"My area of expertise! Not mercenaries per se, but the 30 year war and results. \\n This is not an absolut fact, but I would argue that the 30 year war was the end of mercenaries as the main fighting force:\\nSince mercenaries were a majority they would switch sides depending on who could pay, they had no loyalty to the region at all. In fact I was basically a Pan-European war being fought in Bohemia and central Germany. So lots of mercenaries in a small area, but since they didn't have any loyalty, there was no discipline. They would completely devastate the villages they went through. Rape the women, kill children eat  all  the food. Plus their mobility spread the diseases faster than usual. \\n The result of the war was a 10% reduction of the population of Europe. And in the areas they fought much higher, between 30% to 50%! \\n After this standing armies became used more. And I would say (to my knowledge) never were they used that exclusively again in Europe. \\n Sorry for the lack of sources, I'm at work and don't have time to look it up right now, but this being my area I'll try to verify this later. \\n tl;dr 30 Year War, because it was too brutal \\n Addendum: \\n > The war did much to end the age of mercenaries that had begun with the first Landsknechts, and ushered in the age of well-disciplined national armies. \\n at least wikipedia supports me here... and has a lot more on this. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('These are a lot of questions, and I can\\'t answer all of them, but I can give my perspective.\\nThe idea of a fire ship, that is to ram an enemy ship with a burning ship of your own, seems to be pretty old, mentioned for example in the romance of the three kingdoms, etc. \\n But the first bombs don\\'t come about until the first gunpowder. gunpowder is dangerous in and of itself, and the as the term \"hoisted by your own petard\" indicates an early bomber might have commit suicide quite by accident, but gunpowder was to innefective before the 1800\\'s to be an effective suicide bombing weapon, Guy Fawkes and his coconspirators had to take several trips back and forth to put gather enough gunpowder to even try to blow up parlement, running up to someone with a bomb strapped to you chest just wasn\\'t possible with the technology of the time. \\n To set the stage I should mention european revolutions of 1848 and later which where comparable to the arab spring, it seemed like everyone was having a revolution, the french, the danes the germans, the hungarians etc. My take is that this was a response to the until then disparate benefits the industrial revolution had brought, or at least the ideas behind these revolutions have their roots there. A lot of these revolutions failed, or made insignificant gains. So we have a violent, perhaps fanatical movement that lacks a standing army, in earlier times they might have just had to shut up, but now they have a new weapon: \\n It is tempting to blame Alfred Nobel (invented dynomite in 1867) for the rise of the \"dynamiter\" as they where called durign the victorian age, but more effective explosives such as nitrocelulose (1832) and nitroglycerin (1847) where being discovered left and right. \\n After the vailed revolutions of 1848 the workers, or at least the people who felt they represented them hadn\\'t given up, this is the age of the anarchists, in 1848 Karl Marx had written his communist manifesto. The idea of \"propoganda of the deed\" that the best way to get the people on your side, or to enflame them to action, was public violence such as assasinations. (though the idea is clearly much older) and bombings for example the haymarket explosion in 1886 and the greenwitch park bombing in 1894 (who managed to blow himself up by accident) seems to indicate that bombs where a favorite weapon of the Anarchists (which included comunists, nihilists etc). A first (or at least early) suicide bomber was Tsar Alexander IIs assasin in 1881 who detotanated a bomb at close range to the tsar, fataly wounding them both, though the wikipedia article seems to indicate there was some doubt as to wether or not the assassin ment to die in the attack. \\n This is where suicide bombing gets its real start, the means in the introduction of effective explosives and the motive in the 1848 nationalistic revolutions which largly failed and the following anarchist and eventialy communist revolutions, before that it simply takes to much gunpowder. In addition we have to remmember that murder and treason have been and still are capital offences in many countries, so anyone willing to kill in order to destroy the government is allready risking his life, hopesfuly someone else can pick up the rest of the question. \\n TLDR  the anarchists during the late 1800s where the first \"guirrila\" groups to use bombs to get there way, perhaps out of frustration, have been at any rate they where probably the first to have access to the high explosives necissary to carry out these kinds of bombings. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Well, I never thought I\\'d see a history of translation question asked--I\\'m actually a translator by profession and this was part of my required studies for my degree. I agree with whitesock that your second question is amply covered by the FAQ; I will then focus on how translation was actually done. \\n First off, a little bit of terminology so I can use shorthand: \\n Source language (SL): The language that you are translating  from \\n Target language (TL): The language that you\\'re translating  to \\n A translation always has to choose between the idioms and grammar of the source language and the target language. Generally speaking, the past has favored heavily source-oriented translations because it was felt that they were more faithful to the original by reflecting the author\\'s words. They use TL words, but favour SL syntax and expressions. This is why you\\'ll often hear people call old translations of Tolstoy, for example, \"unreadable\"--my copy of  War and Peace  is very heavily source oriented, and it\\'s a comparatively recent translation (The unfamiliar Russian and French names don\\'t help, but that\\'s beside the point). Target-oriented translation, to counter, tries to express the same ideas as the SL entirely according to TL grammar and expressions.  The Message  Bible is a good example of  TL oriented translation. Translators that favour this method feel its more faithful to the original author\\'s  ideas.  Most modern translation is somewhere in between these two extremes, but more to the TL side. \\n A lot of early translations were done by monks such as St. Jerome, the patron saint of translation and the man who gave us the Latin Vulgate and the wonderfully bizarre Horned Moses. \"Horned\" being, of course, a mistranslation and bringing us to the next point. \\n Translators guess, a lot. We know that people made glossaries (I recall one made for Queen Elizabeth of England with words in Irish, English, and Latin), but didn\\'t necessarily note down nuances, or perhaps (in the case of ancient Greek and Hebrew) were unable to. So they would have started with these, then consulted with colleagues. Unfortunately, one thing you quickly learn as a translator is that most people can\\'t write, or at least can\\'t write what they mean in a clear and understandable way. (I have a book translated from Gaelic ~200 years ago in which the translator had to write an introductory note bemoaning the general incomprehensibility of much of the original and how he was driven to guess.) \\n Small diversion for terminology again: \\n Calque: A word-for-word translation that often doesn\\'t quite make sense in the TL \\n False Friends: When a SL word and a TL word look very similar, but have entirely different meanings. Ex. English \"embarrassed\" v. Spanish \"embarazada\" (pregnant). \\n False Friends in particular cause problems when the translator is not quite as familiar with the SL as he should be, or when the exact meaning of the SL word in context is not entirely clear. Non-standardized spellings can be another issue. A translator might not realize that an odd spelling is actually an odd spelling and not a new and unfamiliar word. So, not knowing what the word is, he tries to guess from what it looks like (false friends) or from context. Often, there\\'s enough context in the surrounding text that the guess will be pretty accurate, but when it\\'s wrong, it\\'s often spectacularly so (cf Horned Moses). \\n There are a lot of other factors that force translators past and present to guess, but they are very similar to the above, so I won\\'t get into it unless someone is interested. The main point is that translation actually hasn\\'t changed all that much from the distant past to the present day. The biggest difference is a greater understanding of ancient languages (in the case of Bible translation) and of word origins, as well as  dictionaries  rather than glossaries, that show all the subtleties and nuances of words in each language. \\n tl;dr Early translators tried to reflect the SL in their TL text in order to remain faithful. They made glossaries and sometimes guessed at words by context or apparent etymology. Sometimes, they calqued the text to the point it was difficult to understand; other times, they fell victim to false friends. Sometimes, they made spectacularly bad guesses. \\n',\n  0),\n ('You may not be getting an answer because this is a  really  difficult question, and one that\\'s not fully within the subfield of any historians I\\'m aware of. \\n I will point out that in the period central to my study (17th century), the Spanish empire had already formed, reached its peak, and begun its decline (if you buy into the \"rise and fall\" paradigm of empires). Spain was in control of the southern half of the Italian peninsula, the Kingdom of Naples, until the second half of the 17th C, and also much of the Netherlands (Spanish Naples and the Spanish Netherlands, respectively). Portugal, though technically independent, was under control of the same monarch. All three of these territories were lost in the course of a couple of decades starting, IIRC, in 1647 with a revolt in Naples. \\n Although it was not in Europe, the Ottoman empire was going strong at this time, too. England was territorially England as we know it today, and France was pretty close. \\n Yet at the same time, Florence and Venice were powerful independent city-states, with central roles in culture, learning, and trade in Europe -- and they would maintain their independence as city-states (again, IIRC) until the unification of Italy in 1865. By that time, of course, European countries as we know them had been pretty well established. \\n TL;DR, it was a long process, and one that was neither pre-determined from the beginning, nor consistent over time or geography. \\n',\n  0),\n ('So the racial development of Mexico is very different from the US, and it stems back to differences in immigration. Whereas in the US it was common to see whole families cross the Atlantic to the US (I\\'m speaking specifically of early settlement-- the mayflower colonies etc), in Mexico and other parts of Latin America the Spanish conquistadors arrived generally family-less, allowing them to have sexual relations (often forced, but not always-- read up on La Malinche for more info) with the native women. Additionally, rather than actively attempting to wipe out the native populations as in the US, the Spaniards for the most part chose to enslave native Mexican cultures for labor. So what ended up happening, particularly as generations passed, were that Mexico became, racially, a blend of native Mexicans and Spaniards. This led to a caste system as a way of creating separation and hierarchy in Mexico. The caste system in Mexico was something like this: Spaniards born in Spain (Peninsulares) > spaniards born in Mexico (criollos) > castas (blanket term for all people of mixed heritage, or mestizos) > Native Mexicans (Indians) > black people, mostly slaves or their free descendants. \\n How the castas section was subdivided and their height in the totem pole of Mexican culture depends a lot on the period, but what\\'s important to recognize is that preoccupation with heritage was obsessive, mostly because what your background was determined the kind of power you could have. Some examples of castes within the casta section were: castizos (child of a European and a mestizo...often ended up considered criollos), mestizos (one Spanish parent and one Amerindian parent. Their status would depend on what culture they were raised in. Only applied to legitimate children), pardos (mix between native, Hispanic, and black), mulatto (1st gen Spanish + black), etc. \\n An atrocious and gross example that may help compare it to the US is thinking about it in terms of dog breeds. so if the US historically is mostly a set of 5+ predominant breeds that tend to mix only among themselves (think of how in many cities you still have Italian, Jewish, Black or Latino neighborhoods -- cultures sticking mostly to themselves) in Mexico it was all essentially a big pile of mutts-- with interbreeding being seen as much more acceptable and possible than in the US (common languages and lack of major influence from non-Spanish culture helps that to happen) with the dogs closest to being purebreds on the Spanish side winning the race. \\n In fact the class system was so rigid that it is partly the thing that inspired the Mexican war of independence-- one of the major reasons Mexico sought to become independent from Spain was that the criollos (people of Spanish descent but born in Mexico) got sick of getting treated as second class citizens. The war of independence became a joint effort between Criollos and mestizos to oust the peninsulares from power. \\n So even historically, despite its rigid caste system there was nowhere near the amount of segregation in Mexico that there was in the United States. They were of different social classes (similar to the class system in England), but these classes were (although not encouraged to intermarry) definitely allowed to interact with each other. Mestizos and indigenas (native Mexicans or Amerindians, the lowest group in the totem pole after slavery was banned) formed key parts of the New Mexican government almost from the beginning -- Benito Juarez became the country\\'s first indigena president less than 50 years after the birth of the country and a good 3 years before the US civil war. To drive that point home-- Mexico\\'s Obama moment was in the 1850s. \\n Of course as time went on, the mestizo community grew and became the majority of the Mexican population. Currently they make up 60% of the Mexican population, with Amerindians at 13% and Mexicans of European descent at 26% (this now also includes German, Italian, Polish, etc populations as well that immigrated during the world wars. The majority remains Spanish though). As it stands, social mobility is very possible for mestizo and white Mexicans, and a little bit less so for Amerindians, largely depending on what state you\\'re in. \\n The 60s in Mexico were more similar to (and I believe inspired by) the 60s student movements in Europe than they were to the US. There was an interest in civil rights, but that was because The Mexican population was reacting to a totalitarian regime. There were union rebellions, student protests, and civilian protests against the lack of democracy (Mexico was run by the same party from 1929 to 1989). The tragic height of these protests was the massacre at Tlatelolco in 1968, where it is estimated that at least a few hundred peaceful protesters were massacred by the government (the official head count was only 20 dead). While tragic, the events weren\\'t race related. \\n As for racism? It\\'s a complicated question. Mexico in many ways defends bit also fetishizes it\\'s Indigenous population. While they remain largely marginalized (partly due to racism, partly due to lack of education and linguistic issues, and partly by choice) they are also looked on fondly, almost nostalgically by the Mexican population at large. It is common, for eample, for major public works to be halted by protests because they happen to pass through native Mexican territory even THOUGH the native populations welcomed or were to be benefited by the construction (I believed this happened in early 2000s near Mexico City. On my phone but I\\'ll cite when I get home.) also in the 90s, a revolutionary leftist group mostly out of Chiapas (a predominantly indigenous region) called the Zapatistas declared war on the \"Mexican elite\"-- their goal being mainly to try to preserve Chiapas\\'s state autonomy and prevent governmental and corporate incursions into the state. This is the closest thing Mexico has had to a strictly indigenous civil movement, although it\\'s died down significantly in the late 2000s. \\n As it stands there is a severe but subtle issue of racism in Mexico. It is cultural and stems from the notion (even to date) that the closer you are to European the better you are. Light skin and European features are highly preferred. There is severe xenophobia (and acts that could be considered hate crimes) towards immigrants from Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua, who either move to Mexico for better opportunities or travel through it to get to the US. The white minority tends to be treated with reverence (if you look at Mexican soap operas, the main characters are almost always white even if they are playing characters belonging in the lower classes). The racism is deep rooted and subtly expressed (and also deeply tied to Mexican values of exclusivity and elitism), so it is considered very hard to eradicate. I suppose it has less of an us vs them feel the way the US has, instead it becomes racism based on degrees (even in a room of relatively light skinned rich kids, if you\\'re the less white kid there, you lose). In 2003 the Mexican government created a council to combat racism, and it is my understanding that they\\'re attempting to tackle racism via national awareness campaigns and an introduction of civic  and social integration material in schools that educates children about human rights and racial/cultural diversity. Also in 2003 the legal language was changed, so that it includes various indigenous dialects as well as Spanish, and there\\'s even an effort underway (or it\\'s already finished?) to translate the Mexican constitution to all major dialects. \\n Again, I\\'m on my phone, so I\\'m afraid I won\\'t be too good at sourcing too much tonight, that said: \\n Jared Diamond\\'s Guns Germs and Steel I believe references the immigration differences between the US and Latin America. The airport incident comes from a FANTASTIC book by Jorge Castañeda called Mañana Forever -- i strongly urge you to read it if you are interested in Mexican cultural analysis (Also a very interesting read for Mexicans). The rest is pulled from my own memory, but I\\'ll happily try to source any info I can. \\n TL;DR: Mexico has been historically much better than the US at institutional inclusion, but is still a very racist country in ways that are completely different from the US and reach way back to the days of colonization. \\n',\n  0),\n ('No. \\n I’m not sure I want to turn this into a historical cmv, but let’s go over some of this. \\n \\n There are no Christians without Jesus. The key features of the movement are religious in orientation. \\n Despite later interpretations, the consistent witness of New Testament documents is to Jesus disavowal of violent means. Neither Jesus nor his earliest followers show any propensity for violence, armed resistance, revolution, insurrection, etc.. \\n The 12 apostles show some social variation, but it’s not that extreme. They are still all Palestinian Jews. \\n There were militant resistance groups. The Zealots seem to have been one. Depending how we understand the term  Sicarii  might have been one. Certainly the later Jewish revolution aka the First Jewish-Roman War (66-73) and the Bar Kokhba revolution (132-135) were they type of thing you are thinking off. They both ended badly. There is no evidence for Christian support or involvement in these.  \\n The main problem with your view, in terms of being “an amateur historian” is that there is simply no evidence to support this view. That’s what history involves, looking at evidence and analysing it and making careful and reasoned conclusions about events. I cannot think of a single document that would support the idea that Jesus was a military leader. \\n So we should still discuss persecution and crucifixion. Christians  were  seen as politically subversive. They proclaimed an alternate Lord and denied ultimate authority to the Roman Emperor. Furthermore they were atheists who denied the gods. Rome was religiously pluralistic, but that doesn’t mean religiously tolerant in a way that we would categorise it. Furthermore, much of the language of early Christianity is framed in anti-Imperialistic language. This even causes problems within Jesus’ lifetime, both in the Judean context and the Roman. The gospels suggest that some did want Jesus to be a revolutionary leader, and the interactions surrounding the trial of Jesus suggest that the Jewish authorities presented Jesus in this way to Pontius Pilate. \\n However crucifixion is not that ‘extreme’  in their eyes  because Jesus is not a citizen and so from the Roman perspective has no real standing. Likewise with early Christians who are crucified – for the most part lack of legal status means lack of rights. \\n You seem to make a category error in aligning “seen as subversive” and “militant resistance group”. Pliny the Younger certainly considers them as subversive, but even he doesn’t think the later is going on.  \\n \\n tl,dr: No, there’s no evidence to suggest this. \\n',\n  0),\n ('I did a little digging to try and find an answer for you, but I\\'ve had only limited success. The short answer is that, for reasons I will explain shortly, I can\\'t find any particular evidence of a situation where a knight would surprise onlookers by indicating just prior to combat that he wanted to joust  à la guerre  (\"as in war,\" or  à l\\'outrance , something like \"to the utmost,\" i.e. death) as opposed to  à plaisance  (or  à plaisir , \"for pleasure\"). \\n First I will caveat all this by saying that, of course, the nature of the medieval tournament varied wildly depending on when and where you look. Courtly jousting existed in some form between roughly the 11th and the 16th centuries. Earlier jousting, which split off from the mêlée to form its own complementary discipline of martial competition around the 13th century, was more often injurious or fatal and more often materialistically motivated by the direct allure of the spoils that could be won by defeating your enemy (his horse, sword, armor, etc). Later jousting was much more focused on chivalrous and rectitudinous behavior, exemplifying the circular relationship between fictionalized chivalric romances and the idealistic knights who tried to enact those values in real life. It was also much safer, partly thanks to the innovation of the \"tilt,\" the barrier between the knights that forced them to ride in a straight line and strike their opponent at an angle as opposed to head-on, increasing the likelihood of breaking the lance and decreasing the likelihood of serious injury. \\n A bit on the distinction between these two types of combat: jousting  à la plaisance  seems to have taken place pretty much exclusively at tournaments, while jousting  à la guerre  could take place at a tournament or, more commonly, between two skirmishing armies. There were indeed different types of lances, as well as armor: for  à la plaisance , a knight would use a lance that was rebated (blunted) or coronelled (fastened with a three-pronged tip that distributed the force more evenly), the later being an innovation of the later medieval period. For  à la guerre , as the name might imply, you basically used the same lance that you used for straight up killin\\' dudes on the battlefield. By the Renaissance, things had calmed down a bit and even  à la guerre  had restrictions to make it less fatal/injurious. (In late medieval Germany, the two formalized styles were called, respectively,  Rennen  and  Stechen  (or  Gestech ).  Maximilian I \\n Now, to your actual question, which is about the challenges: it seems that at a tournament, the challenges took place well beforehand and the terms were made clear to all parties, all the more abundantly so if it was  à la guerre . First of all, the noble personage hosting the tournament assembled his own retinue of knights, who were called the  Tenans  (Middle French for \"those who hold,\" basically); all those other knights who received the challenge/invitation were called the  Venans  (\"those who come\")—basically just the Home and Away teams. A  Tenan  would only challenge a  Venan , and vice versa. A somewhat unexpected—and somewhat suspect—source for the precise nature of the challenges is  a 1907 issue of the British  Pall Mall Magazine : \\n >When [the visitors] have arrived and settled down in their quarters, they will send escutcheons with their arms on them to be hung with others of the challenger\\'s on a tree or artificial arrangement at the lists. Next the visitors will go and with their lances touch certain shields hanging on the tree, and denoting by various hues and colours the different sorts of combats which are to take place. Note will be taken of what shields are touched, and by whom, in order that the necessary arrangements may be made. \\n The early 19th-century British historian Charles Mills, a somewhat breathless and Romantic \"follower of Edward Gibbon,\" corroborates this in his [ History of Chivalry ]( quoting a challenge issued by the knights of Charles V of France in 1389, from Froissart\\'s  Chroniques : \\n >For the great desire that we have to come to the knowledge of noble gentlemen, knights, esquires, strangers, as well of the nation of France, as elsewhere of far countries, we shall be at St. Ingelbertes, in the marshes of Calais, the 20th day of the month of May next coming, and there continue thirty days complete, the Fridays only excepted, and to deliver all manner of knights and squires, gentlemen, strangers of any nation, whosoever they be, that will come thither for the breaking of five spears, either sharp or rockets, at their pleasure;  and without our lodgings shall be the shields of our arms, both shields of peace and of war, and whosoever will joust, let him come or send the day before, and with a rod touch which shield he pleases.  If he touch the shield of war, the next day he shall joust with which of the three he will; and if he touch the shield of peace, he shall have jousts of peace and of war; so that whosoever shall touch any of the shields shall shew their names to such as shall be then limited by us to receive them. [...] \\n So it seems that at a tournament (at least in 14th- and 15th-century France), there isn\\'t really a proper mechanism for same-day challenges, be they  à la guerre  or not. Therefore you might say that such an action would be quite...  outré . \\n As for non-tournament challenges, they were a bit less strictly regulated, but still had their distinctive characteristics. [Back to Froissart]( telling us of an event during a 14th-century English campaign in France: \\n >Present at the skirmish at Toury in Beauce was a squire of Beauce, a nobleman of great eagerness who advanced himself on his own without the involvement of anyone else, who came to the barriers as he fought and cried to the English,  \"Is there no gentleman among you who would perform some feat of arms for the love of his lady? If there is, then here I am, ready to go forth fully armed and mounted to tilt with the lance three times, to land three blows of the battle axe, and three strokes of the dagger. So let there be someone who can undertake such a feat, and all for his lady. Now let us see amongst you Englishmen if there be any of you in love.\"  This French squire was named Gauvain Michaille and his words and request were circulated among the English. Then an English squire stepped forward, an able companion and excellent jouster called Joachim Cator, who said, \"Yes, I will gladly oblige him, so have him come forth from the castle at once.\" The lord of Fitzwalter, marshal of the host, approached the barriers and said to Sir Guy le Baveux who was there, \"Have your squire come out here, for he has found someone who will happily oblige him, and we will assure him his safety in all respects.\" Gauvain Michaille rejoiced at these words, and armed himself immediately with the help of the lords who equipped him fully, and mounted a fine horse which they gave to him. Then, attended by two others, he came forth from the castle, his varlets carrying three lances, three battle axes and three daggers. I can assure you that the English stared at him as he emerged, greatly outraged by the exploit, for they never thought that a Frenchman would dare to fight man-to-man. \\n Yeah, whatever, Froissart. In any case, Mills has a few other examples like this in his book, frequently revolving around formalized declarations of defending a lady\\'s honor or proving one\\'s love or somesuch. These mid-campaign jousts were sometimes a way for squires to win fame and glory, sometimes a way of staving off boredom during a long siege, but almost always  à la guerre  and between knights of opposing armies. \\n TL;DR  In 14th- and 15th-century France, the host of a tournament would set up his knight\\'s shields in an appointed place, where visitors could come and issue challenges by touching the shields with their lances. Tournament joust challenges do not seem to have been issued or altered on the spur of the moment, but rather a day or two beforehand. Depending on the manner/area/color of the lance-touching, this could be an indication of a joust  à plaisance  or  à la guerre . On campaign, challenges (seemingly always  à la guerre ) were more verbal and direct. Wow, this is long. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Disclaimer  This will be primarily about presidential elections because I do not feel qualified to discuss all of the history of the congressional elections. \\n The short answer is no. There have generally been two dominant parties although there are almost always multiple other parties that exist at least in name, though they often lack electoral success. Starting after the creation of the Constitution, there were the democratic-republicans and the federalists. Then the Whigs and Democrats were the major contenders. Finally, upon reaching the civil war, we get the current two parties. You can see a list of election results [here]( \\n There have been times where more than two parties had some electoral success, but they have generally been limited. The Republicans and Whigs coexisted with the Democrats for a while, but it was less than ten years. Then the Whig Party fell apart. The \"dixiecrats\" existed along with the Democrats and Republicans for only the 1948 election and were splinter group of Democrats rather than completely new party regardless. \\n The reason for this is because of the elements of the first past the post system that are explained [here]( Essentially the system makes it beneficial for people to vote for one of two major parties. \\n tl;dr  There are always more than two parties that exist but rarely more than two that are major contenders in the presidential election. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"I disagree, you're conflating two events. I don't think you can draw a causal line from the YTR to the He Jin/Dong Zhuo related crisis. And as for Cao Cao, Sun Jian etc., they were bit players during the YTR no? \\n The YTR itself was actually not that successful, it was crushed in relatively short order and on the field the Imperial armies achieved a number of brilliant battlefield victories. \\n However it is one of the causes of the fall of the Han Dynasty. Because the increased level of chaos forced the large land-owning families, and the men who lead the commanderies and provinces became much more militarized,  each with their private armies and such, which set the stage for a warlord era. \\n You can analyse the Han Dynasty at the time of the YTR as having three primary pillars of support, one was the Empress' clan represented by He Jin and his followers in the gentry, another was the Eunuchs and their associates, and the last were the regional land owning gentries & families. All three of these pillars worked to crush the YTR in remarkably short order. \\n But then they resumed infighting as soon as the YTR was crushed. Long story short, the Empress' clan & the Eunuchs, who hate each other but who are the most crucial pillars supporting the Emperor, as their power ultimately derives from a strong central authority, ended up destroying each other. This immediate decimation of central power, combined with militarized regional clans & governors, basically ended the Empire. Remember the actual reason Dong Zhuo's army was invited into the capital: it was to help the gentry & the remnants of He Jin's loyalists to fight the eunuch faction. \\n Oh as an endnote Cao Cao greatly enlarged his own military from defeated YTR remnants. But that was a while later and the Han Dynasty was already kind of over by then. So yeah, I guess maybe that's a big significance of the YTR - it gave Cao Cao an army. \\n tl;dr: YTR itself wasn't that significant, but it lead the regional powers to militarize and, when combined with the fall of central authority, helped lead to a warlord era. But looking at other times in Chinese history I don't see how even without the YTR the regional powers wouldn't have militarized anyway. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('Haha, a great question inspired by a fun (though not historically accurate) movie. \\n As it sounds like you\\'ve already guessed, the diverse communities of Indigenous peoples of the Americas were (and are), like pretty much all other groups of people, as diverse as the individuals who made them up. Even in Pocahontas, you can see this: Kokoum is different from Powhatan is different from Pocahontas. Some individuals were perhaps more inclined to violence than others, some more likely to broker peace. This is not just true of Indigenous people, though, is it? There were significant battles between rival Indigenous groups in the precontact period; a great essay on this is \"The Battle at Maple Bay: The Dynamics of Coast Salish Political Organization through Oral Histories,\" by Bill Angelbeck and Eric McLay (Ethnohistory journal, summer 2011, p. 359-392). Essentially what this essay describes is how diverse Coast Salish communities united to fight off threatening Lewkiltok raiders. This is an example which shows that the picture is much more complex than what is presented in Disney\\'s Pocahontas movie. Certainly the arrival of Europeans caused the relationships of peace and war between Indigenous communities to become even more complicated; as colonizing powers duked out the balance of power in eastern North America, some Indigenous nations would side with the English, while others took up with the French. \\n One thing that I hesitate to declare as a universal truth (only because I am reluctant to use sweeping generalizations) even while I have only ever seen it to be the case, is the depth of Indigenous knowledge about their territories. When your ancestors have lived in the same place for millenia, you inherit the benefit of all of their combined knowledge about the natural world you live in. So especially in the precontact period, people likely knew a vast deal about the land they lived on. \\n I am also a bit wary of answering the question as it pertains to Indigenous spiritualities. In the Disney movie, Pocahontas seems to be able to speak to animals as well as Grandmother Willow. I do not specialize in Indigenous histories of the eastern coast, so I can\\'t really explore those ideas significantly. On the west coast, Indigenous spiritual lives were directly tied to the land; Coast Salish origin stories explain how the world was made by spiritual beings, who set it right when it was unformed and chaotic. It is likely that for many Indigenous people, there may have been little distinction between \"spiritual\" and \"natural\" knowledge about their territories. \\n But getting to the heart of your question, I think it European texts written about Indigenous histories are often problematic. Some of them, like the Disney movie, romanticize Indigenous cultures, creating an overly-sunny picture of Indigenous lives prior to contact. This is a problem because it means we do not see the full picture. On the other hand, many of these texts are extremely critical of Indigenous lives, calling Indigenous people \"savages,\" \"heathens,\" and referring to them as subhuman. This body of European literature is, of course, also problematic, because it imposes European morality and social mores onto another culture, reinforcing the European idea that Europeans are at the top of a racial hierarchy. \\n I guess the TL;DR here is this: most texts about Indigenous peoples have issues, and Indigenous communities in the pre- and early-contact periods were made up of diverse individuals reacting to sometimes difficult circumstances. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Yes, it is!

Perhaps if you\\'ve seen Jaws, you\\'ll remember that Hooper at one point describes the shark as essentially an automaton focused only on eating and having little shark pups.  Hooper is a highly trained specialist, but he is completely wrong.  Yet for the 70s, that really was what was believed.  Even less was known a half-century before that. \\n This was a time of science - sea monsters were no longer to be believed in, and for the most part things like the \"kraken\" had been shown to be harmless squid, etc.  In fact, in the 1890s a sportsman named Hermann Oelrichs placed a public wager in the pages of the  New York Sun , declaring that sharks were cowardly and that he would give $500 to any person who could prove that a shark had ever hurt anyone. \\n Oelrichs actually made 5-mile swims in the ocean every year to demonstrate his belief that sharks were harmless.

This began to change once you had the creation of a nation-state under Faisal. The state was no longer a multi-ethnic Empire, but associated itself with being Iraqi only, which is an \"imagined\" community. Before this, and even after, the major social cleavages in society were between rural and urban areas, and between settled and nomadic Arabs. And with the propagation of a new Iraqi state, the question of who are the \"Kurds\" began to take shape, as a new singular Kurdish identity was formed, from whence you had a multiplicity of \"Kurdish\" tribes. The issue was not simply Shi\\'ite vs Sunni. \\n In Iraq did some Sunnis live different lives than Sunni\\'s?

When the Grimms actually wrote the tales down, the woods were largely literary devices, serving the same purpose as they do now ('woods' = magic/different/scary place). \\n But when the tales were 'written' - in the long ages before the modernity tamed wilderness through which no legion ever marched, the 'woods' were taken very differently. \\n In one sense, they were believed to be magical...not in a literary way, but literally. European peasants actually thought they were full of faries and goblins and trolls and whitches and god knows what else - hell, jursisprudence from the 1880's shows cases where peasants actually killed people because they thought they were forest goblins/trolls in disguise. So in these stories, the woods were a place where one would, literally, be likely to meet the 'magical' characters of the tales. \\n In a practical sense, the woods were dangerous, even without superstition. \\n 'Woods' were huge, uncharted, unkempt forests (think US national parks, without maps), that were filled, far more than today, with outlaws (they literally lived outside of where the law was), and carnivorous animals. \\n Going into the woods, before the last couple hundred years, meant taking your life in your hands. It was just you, a scrawny, short, likely malnurished peasant with a bow and arrow against gangs of murderous/rapey theives and rebels, as well as numbers of apex predators. \\n The predators part really is hard to understand, from a modern perspective. First, millenia of hunting for the biggest/baddest animals have actually reduced the median size of mamals (this is documented).  We've forgotten this, but back in the dark/middle ages, there were actually great packs of wolves and bears which were larger than today's  what would eat people. On the reg.

While China has endemic corruption issues there is undoubtedly very strong enforcement of basic civil laws - those which are seen by the vast majority of the population. \\n In my opinion (and many others, see: Michael Pettis) we are still early on in China's state-driven expansion. Market driven reforms, which have gone much further than those of the Soviet Union, have combined with the willingness of international capital markets to support China (think: no cold war, but strong desire to see the 'China model' work). This has (again, in my opinion) prolonged the ability of the Chinese government to support cheap state driven investment. \\n Essentially, this boils down to a return on state driven investment versus cost, which most people agrees is vastly detrimental to long term Chinese prospects. To clarify, I mean lower interest rates for private savers, higher inflation and crowding out of private investors by the government. This may (will, in my opinion) degrade the long run economic outlook for China. \\n TL;DR: China may very well experience similar problems to the Soviet Union.

But it owes to the very clear phylogeny of maps among compilers who often never went anywhere near North America but drew their data from the few people who did.  In fact, maps before 1620 that showed Baja California showed it as a peninsula (even though they always had gross positional errors relative to our modern standard of precision cartography). \\n In this case it seems to be one map that\\'s to blame: the 1622 map of Antonio de Herrera, published as part of a book, that drew on textual descriptions from twenty years before [edit: that may in turn have drawn from other such accounts dating back further--\"borrowing\" wasn\\'t limited to maps].  Cartographers of that era were inveterate collectors and often even plagiarists, so the textual account combined with the map made for enough authority to keep the concept going.  It died out because enough geographers (including a lot of Jesuits like Consag and Ugarte) shifted back and eventually (by one report) because the Spanish court declared that it was wrong.  Still, some maps continued to show it because the re-use or purchase of old engraved plates continued to put out the occasional map. \\n For more detail on the point, see McLaughlin and Mayo, \"The Mapping of California as an Island,\" which was an occasional paper of the California Map Society; it\\'s almost certain that  David Woodward (ed)  The History of Cartography  vol. 3 (Chicago: Univ of Chicago Press, 2007) .

In the South, black violence just wouldn't work, the blacks were outgunned, there was a long history of successful violent repression.  What did work was attracting the attention of the world, and particularly of the North, to what had been happening for decades in the South, making it a media event.  And that worked because of the Great Migration to the North, and the fact that in the North, blacks could vote. \\n So Emmet Till's mother lived in Chicago, and publicized the manner of his death in Chicago, and held the funeral, with an open casket and an ugly body, in Chicago.  Rosa Parks was carefully selected as the face of the Montgomery Bus Boycott.  The use of children in the Birmingham campaign led to striking pictures for the North to see, pictures of black children hit by high pressure hoses or threatened by police dogs. \\n The unsung heroes of the civil rights movement in the South were not violent revolutionaries, but the legal staff of the NAACP, who worked through the courts to end segregation, and had great success doing so.  The Montgomery bus boycott, as heroic as it was, would have ended in failure if not for contemporaneous legal action in the federal courts.  The courts, of course, handed down the ruling in Brown vs. Board of Education, but that was part of a very long legal battle.  And black lawyers were in danger in the South -- Martin Luther King took the safer route when he chose to become a preacher. \\n It was after the passage of the Civil Rights legislation in the mid-60s that black revolutionaries gained their greatest prominence, and that was primarily in the North and West.  Malcolm X was ahead of his time, but he, too, was most prominent and successful in the North.  Arguably, Malcolm X gained his greatest prominence after his death, through the publication of his autobiography, and his actual impact during his lifetime has been overstated.  By the time MLK was assassinated, many people already thought that his time had passed, and the reaction to his death was a violent one, but the riots were not in the deep South, but in Washington, D.C.; Baltimore; Louisville; Kansas City; Chicago; and Wilmington, Delaware. \\n After King's death, in the late 60s and 70s, when there was backlash against the Fair Housing Act and desegregation of schools through forced busing, civil rights was no longer just an issue affecting the South.  Many whites in the rest of the country were resentful, but they did not have the history of repression found in the South, so blacks had more freedom to threaten and carry out violence.  On the other hand, whites who opposed integration also had motives to exaggerate the threat of black violence.  Of course, there was also violence that had nothing to do with civil rights, but was more directed towards anti-war protests.  And there were violent protests by whites in the North and West who opposed blacks moving into their neighborhoods or forced busing.  There was also violence by white police against blacks.  But none of that was a factor in King's success; it came after his time, or at least after his greatest success. \\n Sources: Taylor Branch's King Era trilogy, Robert Caro's multivolume biography of Lyndon Johnson, Rick Perlstein's Nixonland. \\n TL; DR: MLK's success protesting against segregation in the South, in a repressive regime, had little or nothing to do with the threat of violence.  Malcolm X had little impact in the South.  Civil rights riots by blacks were mostly in the North, and many of them came after King's success in the South. \\n Edit : I should also add that even when it came to non-violent demonstrations in the South, MLK was far from alone.  He was the face of a movement that started before he rose to prominence and often took place independently of him or the organization he led.  There are other important leaders of that movement, and there are many important participants who made the movement work.  But in the deep South, during the 50s and early 60s, most of them chose non-violent protest simply because violence played into the hands of the racist whites, who had no reluctance whatsoever to use violence to repress the blacks, and were in a much better position to get away with it. \\n That being said, there were blacks in the deep South who armed themselves in self-defense.  Even some of the civil rights leaders advocating non-violence, including MLK, may have employed armed security at times, but if they did so they kept it discrete, since they did not want guns associated with their movement.  One civil rights leader in the South, [Robert F. Williams]( loudly advocated armed self-defense, but was suspended by the NAACP for doing so. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('One thing to consider is exactly what the western media refers to as \"violent\".

But as a precious poster said, there\\'s a difference between violence and preaching self defense and militancy. Negroes With Guns is a fantastic short book which shows a black community arming themselves in the 50s to stop whites from, well, being violent Without restraint.

John Jay retired as the first Chief Justice to serve as the governor of New York; my Federal Courts professor liked to remind us that at least one framer declined to sit on the Supreme Court and, instead, took a job on a state high court. (I can\\'t recall who that is just now.) The Court was not a prestigious appointment until Marshall, to whom we\\'ll return momentarily. \\n I think you overstate Jay\\'s role in coming to the conclusion that the Supreme Court cannot render advisory opinions. This question was in fact debated at the Constitutional convention with Randolph (and Madison) supporting the concept of a Council of Revision, which would square legislative acts with the Constitution  before  their enactment into law. This would have removed the current Article III\\'s requirement that there be a \"case or controversy\" prior to the Supreme Court taking jurisdiction, and therefore, amounted to the issuance of advisory opinions on each and every congressional act. Even before that, the delegates of Massachusetts had proposed a draft that included an advisory opinion power for the Supreme Court -- something already extant in Massachusetts\\' own court. The measure failed. (Source: Hart & Wechsler) Note, too, that the advisory opinion was known at common law, but falling into disuse by the time of 1787. \\n When Jay issued his letters counselling against advisory opinions, then, he was repeating an issue that the Constitutional Convention had actually settled. Perhaps it was novel in that Jay first applied the notion that the convention records comprised significant \"legislative history,\" but this was settled. \\n You also misunderstand the effect of Attorney General opinions. Critically, they bind no-one other than the Attorney General, and then only because the AG doesn\\'t like to reverse itself, and so, won\\'t prosecute someone for an act they have previously decided was legal. Consider AG opinions to be based in  auctoritas  rather than  potestas , to use the Augustan formulation. It is no defense, if an executive officer is sued by a private litigant, that the officer\\'s acts were undertaken at the advice of the Attorney General. \\n Moving on to Marshall -- and this has been a focus of debate for the entire length of the Republic, and before -- the prevailing view is that the judicial review power is both heavily implied by the constitutional structure, and well-documented at the Convention. Though the power was never exactly debated  at  the Convention, it was discussed, and incorporated into [Federalist 78]( It\\'s really hard to argue that the Federalist Papers did not represent the will of the Framers. Query then whether Marshall\\'s decision in  Marbury  was a power grab, or bold only in that it gave form to an as-of-yet-formless principle. \\n Marshall\\'s effect on the Commerce Clause is more contentious. But the newer, shinier view is that of [Akhil Amar]( that \"Commerce\" at the founding was intended to encompass exactly what Marshall made it. \\n tl;dr:  All of the above is to dispute only that Marshall and the early Court invented concepts wholesale.

It is a contentious question and is best not discussed here on a history focused subreddit. This is a question that is better asked on r/askscience. (It is also a somewhat a contentious topic in the science community as well.) Asking it here will get your post deleted!\\n End Disclaimer \\n I want to start with saying that its very dubious to try and diagnose mental disorders based on historical writings, take these with a grain of salt at best. \\n Firstly, lets start with a discussion of FASD itself.\\nThis particular disorder has several particularly major symptoms to it. Deformities of limbs, deformities of the heart, deformities of the face, vision difficulties and hearing problems... Ancient and middle aged medical science was so underdeveloped that the most severe expressions of this disorder would die outright, as well as probably most moderate cases. The high mortality rate of children during these eras (well up to the 1700\\'s) would do the sufferers of this disorder no favors. (It is quite possible the severe expression of it would have contributed to the infant mortality rate over time in ancient peoples, though this is difficult to determine. Possibly the high death rate may have acted to reduce the incidence of the disorder, while the disorder did not significantly contribute to the death rate.) \\n FASD does not occur in all pregnancies when alcohol is consumed. (What I mean by this is, it may have an effect, but be so completely unnoticeable as to be undiagnoseable) The factors that interact with it are many and complex, and we really don\\'t have any particular idea as to why it affects some but not others at varying amounts. Time of consumption IS important though, drinking with in the first 3 months of pregnancy is MUCH more destructive to the fetus than it is in the 2nd and 3rd trimester. This is simply because much of the critical neurological development is occurring in the first 3 months, and alcohol has the greatest effects on these structures at this time. (Note that alcohol consumption does not affect the embryo in the first two weeks of conception, it doesn\\'t do any damage until the blastocyst has implanted into the uterus and resource exchange occurs more directly.) Research is ongoing and is focused on mice and rat analogies, no one really wants to put actual kids through the problems and disability associated with FASD, so a true clinical study of this is difficult. You have to find mothers willing to not only be a part of the study but also willing to drink while pregnant. It is important to note that FASD only is expressed as an environmental condition, much like most teratogenic activity in the uterus. It does not impact the person\\'s genes, as a result, a parent (or both) suffering from FASD will not produce an FASD baby unless the mother drinks while pregnant. The mental disorder occurs ONLY when the fetus is exposed to alcohol. \\n Finally, a major effect on this disorder is severity, which I touched on earlier but didn\\'t really go into much discussion on. A \"textbook\" example of the disorder is understandably severe, and might have difficulty surviving even on modern medicine, depending on complications. A \"minorly\" affected FASD person may be nearly indistinguishable from the general population except by those who deal with and experience the disorder daily and know exactly what to look for in behavior and appearance. These persons function in society just fine, and will probably live a perfectly normal life (for whatever time they exist in)\\nA moderately disabled person is already at a severe disadvantage. Many of them would probably die to various causes, depending on their abilities to cope, some may be able to live a semi-normal life in their time period. Many will probably live in destitution, even by the standards of the time. Severely afflicted persons are unlikely to survive owing to lacking medication and a complete inability to survive on their own.\\nFASD is a major problem today due to the mass production and ready availability of alcohol. It is also strongly correlated with poverty, though it is present at all socio-economic levels. \\n And as to the historical perspective, since we haven\\'t nailed down the requirements as to how much alcohol creates how much FASD, its difficult to say how prevalent the disorder may have been in ancient populations. Since interactions such as time, food intake, amount of alcohol consumption, and good ol\\' genetic resistances all play a role, its difficult to nail down an answer. Chances are that yes, it did occur in the past, its prevalence would be somewhat dependent on alcohol availability in ancient times. A quick search brings up some sources that suggest alcohol was readily available. However one key factor still exists. Specifically, how much alcohol are WOMEN consuming, and in how great a quantity per session. A small amount of alcohol every now and then might not give most children diagnosable FASD (though there is still a chance it will.) \\n The website,  claims that drinking to the point of being drunk was actually fairly rare. If this is the case, then chances are you\\'d have mostly \"light\" and \"moderate\" expressions of FASD, these persons would be able to cope and survive reasonably well. You would probably notice deviations from the norm among afflicted individuals, depending on prevalence, they would still have a harder time functioning than most would. Interestingly, if the majority of persons are FASD, those that are normal might learn to act like an FASD person to an extent, without actually having the disability... \\n TL/DR: Yes, FASD likely occurred in the past. It is not expressed at the genetic level, it only occurs if the mother drinks while pregnant. \\n Final Note: The most critical point for fetus vulnerability to alcohol (and other teratogens) is the first trimester. Second trimester will still have some risk of strong effects, but they will be somewhat muted. Third trimester is mostly about weight gain and finishing off development, alcohol exposure here is not as damaging. \\n Sources: \\n Good generalized non scholarly sources: \\n Edit: Cleaning up wall of text/ a bit of clarification.\\nEdit2: Some phrasing I wasn\\'t happy with.\\nEdit3: Changed some tone.

Kings tended to rule a nation(this is being used in the modern geopolitical sense), while Emperors ruled a larger imperial \\'state\\'. For example, Mursili II was \\'king\\' of the Hittites as a ethnic groups and the land of Hatti as a geopolitical area(the area around Corum province roughly in Turkey). But, he was also the emperor of the Hittite empire, which in his reign included all of this: \\n In the Bronze Age, their wasnt much of a linguistic distinction between \\'king\\' and \\'emperor\\', but a king(as opposed to the closest term for emperor \"great king\")often could only list one to two regions under their rule, for example: \\n \"all the lands from Zalpuwa by the Sea. Formerly Mr. Uḫna, King of Zalpuwa, carried off our god from Neša to Zalpuwa. Later I, Anitta, Great King, carried back our god from Zalpuwa to Neša. I brought Ḫuzziya, King of Zalpuwa, alive to Neša.[2]\" \\n Huzziya is king only of the city state of Zalpuwa, while Anitta(a early Hittite king)is the \"great king\", for he rules lands that are not just his core territory. \\n In the Late Bronze Age, their was technically considered to be only a few \"great king\" states in international diplomacy, Arzawa, Ahhiyawa(Greece maybe), Babylon, Assyria(After around 1300 BC), Hittites, and Egypt. Being a great king simply meant you could sit at the big boy table in terms of diplomacy, you could exchange gifts and correspondence as a equal sitting assured of your power, rather than vying for minor symbols of power as a lower king.

Mexico in 1821, 1822 for Venezuela, Ecuador, and Colombia, and Peru in 1824. By 1818 the Chileans and Argentinians had  de facto  pushed the Spanish out of South-South America and 1821 they were fully pushed out. It took a few decades for them to be recognized but conclusively, by 1850, Spain had lost its entire mainland colonial holding in the Americas but its Caribbean holdings would also experience quite a number of revolts through this time in the revolutionary fervor. By 1898 Spain was conclusively out of the picture and was, by all measurements, no longer a colonial power with the loss of Guam, Puerto Rico, Cuba, and the Philippines to the Americans. \\n It was racked with war in the Napoleonic Wars, lost its massive colonies in the 1810's and 1820's, and lost whatever it had left in global influence/projection in 1898 to America. It was dirt freaking poor, without anything resembling a modern navy or army, and was just scraping by. Basically no one really wanted them. Whatever hope they had to join in on the fray last minute was killed in 1909 with what is called the Second Melillan campaign; it was an absolute disaster. They had  no  professional troops and basically conscripted a bunch of poor laborers (all the rich people bought off their conscription) and threw them into North Africa to quell a revolt. They were completely bashed in their offensive against 'easy' colonial natives and had to conscript more men and essentially pound them down with superior numbers to stop them. Through this revolts would spread across Spain like wildfire exacerbated by the failure of the campaign, economic downturns, and so on. \\n Essentially the line of reasoning was this: Spain lost all of her colonies and thus her wealth. What little glimmer of hope she had to be considered a Great Power through her extensive island possessions and force projection was lost when they were embarrassed by the Americans; the Spanish Empire was recognized to have been a facade at that point and the Americans exposed them and put the final nail in the coffin. Being at most a second rate power she would be reduced below even that when she couldn't even handle a bunch of untrained, loosely organized native peasantry in a colony; how the heck were they supposed to stand up to a Prussian or a French battalion? They'd be wiped out without contest. They were a liability at best. \\n Most reason of all though Spain benefited from trading with all sides in the war. A loose paraphrase I like is that it's said the United States won WWI as it entered the war as a beefy regional power and exited as a world power. They benefited, quite clearly, the most of the war. Spain and other neutral powers like that come in second. Their economy experienced a boom by standing on the side lines selling steel and fruits in particular to both sides. \\n So ultimately:  Why would they?  France wanted Alsace-Lorraine and to contain Germany, Russia wanted to protect Serbia, Britain wanted to contain Germany and protect Belgium, Italy wanted Austro-Hungarian lands (especially Tyrol and Trieste)...what beef does Spain have with Germany or Austria-Hungary? What land would it take from them or did it have any claim to? What did it have to gain from going to war with the Ottomans later on even? They'd be on the winning side but at what cost when they could just sit it out? Opposite is even worse...I imagine they'd go for Gibraltar or Southern France but they'd be molly-whooped. The Brits would have had absolutely zero issue enforcing a full embargo on Spain as well as well as maintaining defense at Gibraltar. Invasions from Gibraltar, France, and likely Portugal would topple their government in a measurably short amount of time. \\n TL;DR:  Divided populace, shitty military showmanship in 1898 and 1909/10, poor and no more global presence, nothing resembling a modern military force and really no reason to go to war. War with Entente was winning less economically than staying neutral with no benefit of territorial gain and wouldn't be able to contribute enough to gain financial reparation. War with Central Powers meant land grabs against her, total and quick occupation, further economic collapse, total embarrassment, etc. Just total destruction. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('Oh come on.  You can\\'t seriously be asking us to believe that this Kenobi terrorist was able to alter the orbit of a large celestial body and cause it to collide with a planet, all because of some hokey religion.  That\\'s patently absurd. \\n Moreover, the rogue impact theory has some major flaws which it\\'s proponents have yet to provide any explanation for.  Professor Nnqueubss\\'s recent meta-analysis of numerous surveys of the Alderaan Debris Field shows that the field is isotropic to an enormous degree of precision.  An impact would have caused a significant directional bias in the resultant debris field, yet this signature is totally absent in the case of Alderaan. \\n Edit: \\n I\\'ve had messages pouring in over the comm asking which Alderaan Destruction theory I believe, as I seem to be arguing against the only two most people are familiar with, so I thought I would add some clarification here. \\n As I\\'ve pointed out, the rogue impact theory has some major flaws, but at least it\\'s physically plausible and makes falsifiable predictions.  Mystical superpowers aside, it\\'s conceivable that a large number of propulsive devices could be affixed to a large asteroid or a small moon and used to divert it\\'s path into the planet.  For my money, this theory was only truly dispelled once more precise measurements of the debris field showed that it was too isotropic to have been the result of an impact. \\n The \"super weapon\" theory is far more laughable.  There was a great deal of super weapon chatter immediately following the destruction of Alderaan, and many people quickly seemed convinced that a beam weapon of some sort was involved.  This might have made sense, however anybody familiar with the physics of beam weapons quickly realized that collimating such a beam would have required a platform substantially larger than most planets. \\n There are some novel composite-beam designs which have been proposed, but even those would have required a platform the size of a small moon.  Building such a structure would have necessitated the diversion of a significant proportion of the galactic GDP, and the only shipyards large enough to facilitate construction on that scale are Kuat and Corellia.  Such construction could not possibly have gone unnoticed. \\n So what really happened on Alderaan? \\n For decades it has been a mystery because, until recently, access to the Alderaan Debris Field has been heavily restricted, almost certainly because of the political and propaganda value which the two leading theories both yield to their respective proponents. \\n Thankfully, those restrictions have been relaxed in the past several years, the first high quality scientific data has begun to emerge, and we are able to reconstruct the events of the fated planet\\'s last weeks and days. \\n Those familiar with the history of energy generation on Alderaan may recall the ill-fated Thermal Borehole project.  Briefly, the premise was that the planet\\'s energy needs could be satisfied by drilling boreholes through the crust and a significant portion of the planet\\'s mantle, to extract radiogenic thermal energy.  This was largely a political pet project instigated at the behest of the environmental lobby, and failed spectacularly to deliver on it\\'s promises, yielding only around 1% of the promised power output.  The boreholes were quietly retired, and Alderaan shifted to the usage of modern power-plant designs for it\\'s energy needs. \\n Not satisfied, the environmental lobby began to complain that these power plants were generating far too much waste, which was being shipped off planet and dumped in designated regions of interstellar space.  They demanded that a waste remediation strategy be implemented. \\n It was at this moment that some well-meaning idiot remembered all of those abandoned thermal boreholes.  They proposed that instead of being shipped off planet, all of that power core waste could be dumped into the boreholes, where it\\'s density would allow it to sink down to the planet\\'s core and decay over geological timescales. \\n It\\'s not clear exactly when and how the political decision was made to pursue this plan, but many signs seem to point towards the House of Organa, a longtime friend of the environmental and peace-nik movements.  Regardless, the decision was made, and dumping commenced. \\n What nobody realized at the time was that when subjected to high pressures, power plant waste recrystallizes into a remarkably resonant structure.  As the waste traversed the mantle, it underwent this recrystallization.  Continuing it\\'s downward travel, it passed the Gutenberg discontinuity and entered the molten core.  Here it rapidly diffused, propelled by the swirling eddies of the magnetic dynamo at the planet\\'s center. \\n Once a certain density threshold was crossed, the resonant waste material was able to sustain waves which circled all the way around the core. As dumping continued these waves grew stronger and stronger, until eventually they became supercritical.  Over a period of several minutes they underwent a runaway amplification phase, and eventually \"ignited\" the waste in the core.  In essence, the entire planet of Alderaan was turned into one colossal power generator.  The output would have been immense, far larger than the gravitational binding energy of the planet, and in short order the planet exploded. \\n Recent examinations of the chemical signature of the Alderaan Debris Field provide compelling evidence supporting this theory.  For anybody interested in reading into this subject further, I recommend starting with the seminal paper by Ranna Werjua, which was responsible for kicking off the entire field of study. \\n TL;DR:   Idiot environmentalists blew up their own planet. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"This question I answered earlier should give you what you're looking for. Suffice to say, the ANZACS were quite important in the war effort of the British Empire. Australia provided five infantry divisions, New Zealand one, to the British army, and they served in I & II ANZAC Corps. From 1916 to 1918, both corps were involved in the major campaigns of the BEF, with the Australians seeing bloody fighting at Fromelles, Pozieres and Mouquet Farm during the Somme Campaign, while the New Zealand Division and the Canadian Corps were involved in the Battle of Flers-Courcelettes, also during the Somme campaign. \\n In 1917, the Australians fought at Arras in April, 1917, notably around Bullecourt, and played an important role in the 2nd Army victory at Messines Ridge. The ANZACs fought at Third Ypres ('Passchendaele'), and were involved in some of the bloodiest fighting there: Broodeseinde, on 4th October, which Ludendorff called 'a black day for the German army' (there may have also been war crimes committed here by Australian troops); and at the subsequent, bloody repulses at Poelcapelle and 1st Passchendaele, the latter being the New Zealanders bloodiest episode of the war. \\n In 1918, the Australian Light Horse launched a successful cavalry charge at Beersheba, part of the British army's victories in Palestine and Mesopotamia. I & II ANZAC Corps were involved in heavy fighting on the Western Front, winning an important success at Villers-Bretonneux, and with John Monash's I ANZAC Corps forming part of the spearhead at the Battle of Amiens, on August 8th, 1918, which Hindenburg called 'The Blackest Day for the German Army in the War thus far'. They pierced the Hindenburg Line at St. Quentin, the New Zealanders capturing an old fort at Le Quesnoy, and from August 1918 onwards the ANZACs were involved in the 'Hundred Days Offensives', which constitute probably the greatest feats of arms on land, in the history of the British Empire. \\n I guess TL;DR: the ANZACs were an important part, of a much greater whole \\n\",\n  0),\n ('In short, yes.  But I don\\'t know if this  generally  pre-dates the emergence of modern nationalism.  It\\'s not rare today for Maronite Lebanese Christians, for instance, to insist that they are \"Phoenician\" rather than \"Arab\".  Copts in Egypt similarly sometimes emphasize their Arabness, sometimes emphasize that they are the true descendants of the Ancient Egyptians (their language, Coptic, is directly descended from the language of the Ancient Egyptians).  Assyrian Christians often emphasize their association with Assyria (as well as, to what is as far as I can tell a less degree, to the Syriac speaking Christians of the Roman Empire).  Chaldean Christians (also Syriac speaking) often emphasize their connections to Babylon rather than Assyria.  Greeks in the Ottoman Empire were known as  Rum  since they were the descendants of the (Eastern) Roman Empire.  Their early nationalism focused as much on Constantinople as Athens, if not even more so.  The Megali Idea of the Greek Nationalists was in part to revive the glory of Byzantium. \\n Here\\'s a little bit on the history of  the Assyrians .  Here\\'s more on the [Megali Idea]( \\n Again, I don\\'t know if there has been a continuous knowledge that \"things were so much better when we ruled!\", but there have been consistent naming practices of these groups throughout Muslim rule ( Rum  Romans,  Assouri  Assyrians) that there must have been some collective attachment to historical greatness, at least among the elites (especially interesting is the case of the Chaldeans, who only really emerged out of a split within the Assyrian Church and named themselves in the 16th/17th centuries, which is before the onset of nationalism in the region, something that really only dates to the 19th century).  I am confident that all of this attachment to pre-Muslim greatness only increases in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  It was not limited to non-Muslim groups, however.  The Turkish government in the first half of the twentieth century pressed (largely ahistorical) connections to the Hittites and Sumerians.  Two of the largest state development banks formed in this period, for example, are Etibank and Sümerbank.  This was done in part to counter Greek and Armenian claims to Anatolia.  Anatolia was an essential part of Greece since pre-Roman times, and of course the center of the Byzantine Empire; Armenian history similarly is more centered around Lake Van and Mt. Ararat in Turkey than Yerevan in modern Armenia, which was something of a backwater. \\n tl;dr:  I can\\'t tell you if they said things like \"Things were better under the Romans\" (well, I\\'m sure that\\'s in plenty of Ottoman Greek writings, but I don\\'t know if it\\'s true generally), but there was plenty of awareness that \"We are intimately related to these pre-Muslim groups\", especially after the rise of nationalism in the 19th century. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Aha! Military history; that\\'s a remarkably broad topic. Let me see if I can... \\n What is the history of military history? Geeze, that\\'s a tough question. How long have people been telling each other stories about their heroism in war? War and conflict are so inextricably linked to humanity that even the very earliest of our stories involve it. It\\'s just so full of drama – that, coupled with prowess in battle getting linked pretty early on in a fair few cultures to manly virtue, so these stories became quite important. Tablet V of the Epic of Gilgamesh details the heat of battle. War fills the pages of the Old Testament. The Iliad... well, yes. War and virtue (- actually more accurately in the Iliad it\\'s something more like \\'rage and pity\\', but I digress). \\n But I suppose the type of modern history – the type where we are fairly confident of sources, and such – that type actually probably dates from von Ranke. War and Great Men are quite closely linked – most of the “history” Ranke speaks of in his  History of the Romanic and Germanic Peoples from 1494 to 1514\"  is related to conflict in some way. It\\'s useful, see? War polarises people; it creates strong in-groups and out-groups. If you\\'re going about a nation-building project, then one of the first things you do is write histories about your particular group against the world. \\n All this kinda feeds into your question about bias, by the way – military history has  charge . Oh, how it has charge. It is used to tell people parts of their identity; it\\'s used by whole societies to tell it about its identity. Military history is simultaneously the single most popular thing to buy if you\\'re a member of the general public, and also the single most looked-down upon subject if you\\'re a member of the historical community. I was forced by my Ivy-plus graduate school to stop calling myself a military historian so I could get funding. It\\'s almost like being popular makes the history  less  somehow – which in some ways is true. It is harder to fight against established myths if people already believe something else. That charge makes it impossible to not have bias; even writing in English gives you one set of assumptions that you can\\'t escape from. War has bias. It can\\'t not have. People are trying to break the opponent in a very mental way, by applying physical force. It\\'s not exactly a neutral equation. \\n I digress though. How has the field evolved? Well over the last forty years, we Military historians have undergone a revolution. Sadly... and I hesitate to say this, but I will – it\\'s because the veterans that monopolised the telling of military history before the 1980s started to retire and die. When the folks who had no direct experience of war stepped it, they started looking more broadly at the cultures that fight, and the impacts on various groups of people that weren\\'t soldiers. We call it “New” military history, and it is far more inclusive – it rose of a wave of post-modernist theory. Where once it was battles, Great Captains, and technology, now it is far more refugees, the price of bread in Berlin, and ways of mass grieving. \\n The Great War has undergone this process the most radically – forgive me if I err, but I believe the change from Old-style to New military history was actually first done in France, and with regards to the First World War. It was easier for the French to understand that war and culture were together because they never had the idea of the Great War “home front” and the “front line” like English-speakers did. After all, France was a battlefield; the lines between what was the front and what was the rear were much more blurred. One of the French 80s historians finally asked “what IS a home-front?” and the whole movement towards New Military History was all on. ((If you\\'re interested, I\\'d recommend Jay Winter. Anything by him. Wow.)) \\n As for what we use as sources... personally I use anything I can get my grubby hands on. You MUST see the ground – I remember a historian of German Medicine being boggled by my insistence that you treat the actual physical ground as an artefact to be studied. Sometimes you build up impresses from reports, and when you get to the ground you realise that couldn\\'t possibly have happened – some officer has spun you a yarn. We use reports; we use the location of bullet cases; we use novels; we use oral history. War is a human experience, and damn is it huge. It impacts everything in that society; like you\\'ve put a culture into a pressure cooker and then violently flung it against another pressure-cooker. The gaps are still huge though; war is chaos by its very nature, and people reporting on it later are trying to make sense of it. Having written military reports myself, I know just how much invention goes into the story you tell – “did it really happen like that? I think it might have, but I don\\'t really know for sure.” War is very distracting, while you\\'re in it – that is why everything must be so simple in an army, because even the simplest things are hard. \\n As for what are the “big questions” - huh, with war they\\'re always big. They pretty much all boil down to “was this ethical?” - and you can\\'t really ever know that. You can argue back and forth all day until you want to scream. But as I said before – war has charge, and it was linked to manly virtue for a  long time  (and still is). People ask these questions because they\\'re worried about concerns in the present day, not about the past. \\n TL;DR Military history is awesome. \\n \\n and thanks to laertes78, because I fully derped out and forgot the name of von Ranke\\'s book. \\n \\n',\n  0),\n ('I can only answer the \"unrelated question\": it got mostly expunged from Anatolia in 1923. \\n In 1923, about 1.5 million \"Greeks\" were forced to leave Anatolia, about 200,000 were allowed to stay (around Istanbul, and in Thrace, the region between Istanbul, Greece and Bulgaria), while 500,000 \"Turks\" were forced out of Greece.  Keep in mind, Turks/Greek were religious categories, so you could be a monolingual Greek speaking Turk or a monolingual Turkish Speaking Greek, or a Greek who only spoke Pontic Greek, which is maybe like saying you were a Spaniard who only spoke Italian.  Anyway. \\n The Greeks in the 19th century achieved independence and slowly extended their state.  Borders weren\\'t nearly fixed like they are today.  The Greek nationalist had what they called the \"Megali Idea\" (The Great Idea), which basically was to get all the Greeks back in one state, revive the glory of days gone by, etc.  Here\\'s  one proposed map , but the Greeks were  sure  they\\'d pick that up, too, just in a few years (they were on a roll).  Here\\'s [a good map]( of the growth of the Greek state.  Notice the  huge  area in Western Antolia around Izmir/Smyrna that was Greek from 1919-1923.  The Ottoman censuses, especially the ones around the time of nationalism, are hugely unreliable, but many people think that the much of coastal Anatolia, and especially the cities there, was Greek plurality or maybe even majority.  I know mainly from the Turkish side, but I believe that Greeks dreamed of Istanbul/Constantinople as their capital at this point. \\n The thing is, the  Sultan  signed the Treaty of Sevres ending WWI in 1919, a treaty which SUCKED for Turkey.   Here\\'s how it left Turkey  were under Greek control.  Three of the big Eastern Cities (Trabzon, Erzurum, Van) were under Armenian control.  The entire south was occupied by European powers, but it was expected that they\\'d set up a \"mandate\" which is just League of Nations for \"colony\" in those areas (they would have been contiguous with other territories the Europeans controlled).  Keep in mind Ankara was still pretty much a backwater at this point (it only grew after being declared the capital of the Republic) so Turkey was really left with a couple of rinky dink cities and an agricultural hinterland. \\n If you want to understand why Ataturk is so loved in Turkey, look at that map then look at a map of modern Turkey.  He said \"Screw Sevres, we\\'re Turks, damnit, a proud and noble people\" and between 1919-1923, Turkey got pretty much all the land they could have hoped to claim in the new era of nation-states.  They wiped out the nascent Armenian state.  They even managed to negotiate with the Soviet Union and get Kars and a few other palces that had been part of the Russian Empire.  They got rid of all the European expeditionary forces.  They routed the Greeks and expelled them from Anatolia, regaining Edirne and Izmir.  They kept control of the Kurdish region.  The Lausanne Treaty, the peace with Greece, involved  a massive transfer of populations  between 1912-1923.  There was also the \"Pontic Genocide\" during WWI that was in parallel to the Armenian Genocide where hundreds of thousand of Greeks died, many just drowned in the Black Sea (I don\\'t like the term genocide, but yes, systematic government organized killings, ethnic cleansing of a massive murderous scale).  By 1923, because of all the nationalist/ethnic fighting, there were only a few hundred thousand Christians in Anatolia anyway (quite possibly fewer than died in the Pontic Genocide), and \"the population exchange was as much a \"you can never come back again\" as it was an exchange.  Woo.  Ataturk basically got all the land he dreamed of for the Turkish state, minus just the Mosul province in Iraq (majority Kurdish, but so is much of Southeastern Turkey--why the British cared was oil) and the Alexandretta Sanjak (modern Hatay province, including Antioch/Antakya.  Province was about 50/50 Arab and Turkish under French mandate.  It\\'s still officially claimed by Syria, but Ataturk got it in the 30\\'s).  The new Republic of Turkey\\'s population was 95+% Muslim, probably a good 60-80% or so Turkic speaking.  Great success!  There were about 200,000 Greeks around Istanbul in 1923, but various targeted policies and a pogrom in 1955 meant that their numbers continually declined, and even by the 70\\'s there were only a few thousand left.  Today there are officially two to three thousand, mostly elderly ethnic Greeks in Turkey. \\n I should point out that this was probably a larger scale than in most places, but similar process went on all over Central and Eastern Europe from about 1910 to 1945 or so. \\n tl;dr:Greeks had a large presence in Anatolia and for most of the 19th century hoped to incorporate much of western Anatolia, maybe even Istanbul/Constantipole, into the Greek State.  These dreams only lasted until 1923, when most Anatolian Greeks were \"exchanged\" for Muslims from Greece after a solid decade of various wars in the region, the last two years or so of which went awfully for the Greeks.

Handing over to the orphans their property means to give it back to them, into their possession; (the verb used is ad-daf (to repulse, to push away); it is as though the guardian pushes the property away from himself; thus it is in spite of its triteness, a very fine metaphor. \\n The clause, \"until they reach (age of) marriage\", is related to the verb, \"test\"; it thus shows that the testing should be a continuous exercise. The guardian should start testing the orphan as soon as he shows some discretion and appears ready for such tests, it should continue until he reaches marriageable age and becomes a \"man\". The order by nature demands this continual process, because one cannot find out whether the child has attained maturity of intellect just by testing him once or twice; \\n the test must be repeated again and again until the guardian finds out the orphan\\'s maturity of mind and it becomes a part of his nature until he reaches puberty and then the marriageable age. \\n The words, \"then if you find in them maturity of intellect\", branches from the imperative verb, \"And test\"; and the meaning is as follows: Test them, and if you find in them maturity of intellect, hand over their property to them. \\n The wording shows that the orphan\\'s reaching the age of marriage is the basis of returning his property to him and of bestowing on him the power to manage his estate independently. Maturity of intellect is the necessary condition for bestowal of authority of independent management. \\n Islam has laid down two different standards regarding al-bulugh (majority, adulthood) for two different sets of responsibilities: As for the acts of worship and matters like penal code the majority begins on reaching a prescribed age, but for financial affairs, acknowledgements and other such dealings (details of which are given in the books of jurisprudence) mere attainment of age is not enough, he must also achieve maturity of intellect. This differentiation throws light on the highest refinement and sophistication, which Islam has maintained in its legislative programs. Had it disregarded the maturity of intellect in financial and similar dealings, the social life would have suffered disorder and chaos-as far as orphans and other wards were concerned. Had they been given power (just on reaching a certain age) to independently manage their finance or to make agreements or acknowledgments, etc.; it would have given a chance to mischief-makers to mislead and deceive them. Cunning hoaxes could have defrauded them of all their means l of livelihood, with their smooth talks, false promises and swindling deals. Therefore, it was essential to impose the condition of maturity of intellect in such matters. But obviously there was no need to put this condition in the things like acts of worship, etc.; also it was not necessary in such affairs as penal code. One does not need sharp mind or maturity of intellect to understand and perceive the evil of these crimes and sins or to realize that one should desist from them. Man understands such things long before attaining maturity of intellect, and one finds no difference, in these matters, between the perception gained before maturity of intellect and that achieved afterwards. \\n \\n tl:dr: \\n 4:6 establish that one must be mature intellectually, and that one must be tested and prove to be intellectually mature in order to get married. Therefore, any marriage to a nine year old should be invalid and considered illegal in Islam. It is therefore permissible to believe that the Prophet married an older and mentally mature Aisha, and not one who was nine years old as is corroborated in the hadiths, that state she was in her late teens/early twenties. \\n',\n  0),\n ('I\\'m not sure I agree with the generalization of \"Arabs\" in general, but this piece does cite Kenneth Pollack\\'s work on the Iran-Iraq War.

The Internet’s obsession with these issues, especially in simplistically identifying “Calvinism” with an astringent and abstract double predestination, is a projection back onto Calvin of ideas from later Calvinists that were not central to his own thought. Did Calvin accept “double predestination”? Of course. But it did not mean to him what it did to, say, the Westminster divines. Nothing about the doctrine of justification, including the idea of election, was as important to Calvin as it was to Luther, and it certainly was not as important to him as the ecclesiological matters that really focused his attention. \\n The only issue that really divided Luther and Calvin in a fundamental sense was the differing ways they understood Christ to be present in the Lord’s Supper. Even this was originally a disagreement between Luther and Zwingli, both of whose positions Calvin came to reject. \\n Luther believed the presence of Christ in the communion elements was real and physical, though the elements remained bread and wine (in contrast to the Roman view that they became in essence the flesh and blood of Jesus while keeping the sensible traits of bread and wine). He did this by transforming the idea of the “communication of properties” from a rule of speech (which it had been in the ancient church) into a straightforward description of reality. Cyril of Alexandria had clarified that one could say that “God wept,” because Jesus wept at the tomb of Lazarus. It is an appropriate way of speaking because of the union of the two natures. The man Jesus wept, and because his humanity had been assumed by God in a personal union, we could say that in that sense God wept. Using that same logic, Luther wants to say that Jesus is (or can be) everywhere at once, because God can be. As God had assumed the human nature of Jesus, you could say Jesus is everywhere. Luther then turned this into a straightforward description of reality. Jesus can be physically present everywhere the Lord’s Supper is celebrated, and his flesh and blood could therefore be received with the bread and wine whenever it is celebrated. Luther believed it was important to be able to say that even an unbeliever who takes the elements receives the flesh and blood of Christ. That was a kind of test question for him. \\n Zwingli thought this was all perfect nonsense and taught that the bread and wine are symbols. The presence of Christ is a mental exercise, and not real in any sense. \\n Calvin took a position between these, though whether he intended this as a compromise or not is debated. His view was that there was a close connection betweens the sign and the thing signified, but that the signs (bread and wine) were physical and the thing signified was spiritual. The handy tag the tradition has hung on this view is “spiritual real presence.” As Calvin saw it, Christ was spiritually present to the congregation in the celebration of the Lord’s Supper in a distinctive way that went beyond the everyday presence of Christ in a believer’s life. \\n Luther lumped Calvin in with “the sacramentarians,” (by which he meant everyone who didn’t believe some kind of physical real presence) and rejected this teaching completely. Calvin reached out to others in the Swiss Protestant community to try to find ways to overcome their differences and he did reach an agreement with Bullinger, Zwingli’s successor at Zurich, the Consensus Tigerinus, but this was never very satisfactory to anyone. \\n This is obviously a bunch of theologia, and it's hard for people in our time and place to see why it was so important in theirs, but it made sense to them. It was the one really significant issue that insurmountably divided Luther and Calvin. This difficulty is why I was slow to respond here, but since the discussion seems to have taken off I figured I would throw it into the pot. \\n EDIT:  TL; DR: Calvin wasn't interested in the same things Luther was. The only thing they really disagreed about  was where Jesus was when a congregation celebrated communion. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"A big thing to consider is that what we have today, essentially 50 districts within the United States is a lot different from the understanding of a state at the time.

Southern states, in their bid to maintain slavery which was essential to their economy, felt that it was no longer in their best interest to maintain that legal bond, and so they tried to dissolve it.

The border states were allowed to keep slavery, and the move was more meant to incite slave rebellions in the south and affect their war making ability. \\n The war originally started because the North and South were two very different \"Nations\". The North was heavily industrialized and more advanced and many contemporary writers compared the North/South situation to a colonial situation. The north owned many institutions in the South and used the raw materials from their to make manufactured goods and sell them in the South.

To keep it simple, the key to German military success in 1939 and 1940 was not in numbers, but in state-of-the-art tanks and planes that were used in unheard of ways, leading to decisive breakthroughs.

All the valuable valuables would have already been taken away by the soldiers who worked there or by the nazis to sell and use to feed the war machine. This was a constant process throughout the camp's life. There was never very much left of those who went into the camps because the Nazis made a point of 'reusing' everything. Hair was shipped to the army to be used as bedding. Fillings were melted down and sold. Shoes were sold or taken by the officers if they liked them. The bodies themselves were the only bits that weren't recycled and were instead incinerated. \\n So there would not have been much to clean up because the Nazis were so efficient. Most of the main camp was destroyed in the days before the camps fell and the weeks and months afterwards. The fleeing Nazis destroyed the major crematoria so that it could not be used as evidence.

The huts were pulled apart immediately after the fall of the Nazis from the area so it would be very surprising if anything but the soviet soldiers did the work of pulling the camps apart. \\n TL:DR There wasn't a lot to clean up.

He points the the fact that even in stable pre-colonial central and north african kingdoms and tribal lands, authority was rarely determined by land control(since there was so much of it, claiming the few hundred miles between two landmasses would have been unenforcable) but by control of populations (which were also dispersed by the vastness of the continent), borders were more fluid compared to central asia and europe it was much easier for a person under the rule of one leader to move out of that leader\\'s reach of authority and into another. And though some great crossroad cities did emerge, the fluidity of the populus never made infrastructure a concern outside of these trade hubs (which, of course, were often the capital location for more powerful leaders, thus they had more authority and control over the population). but still, power projection was still limited by the vastness of the land and how disperse the population was \\n Then comes colonization, what makes Herbst analysis so interesting is he argues that since european colonies were often no more than administrative zones for wealth extraction, even to the point sometimes of leaving local leaders in place, infrastructure never developed outside of the coast and major trade cities (the places with existing infrastructure). More interesting is that the Berlin conference that carved up africa for the colonizers paid little interest to the hinterlands, it would be like drawing a map of the US  with the focus of gaining political control of the area around LA and NYC. As a result european colonist found themselves in a similar situation as pre-colonial inhabitants, limited political authority in the hinterlands, and the ability to move freely in protest of policies. \\n Finally we get to the big point of my long rambling summary. Large scale war and threats from the exterior rarely came into being in Africa because of these geographic factors, thus the necessity of strong borders was never realized to the same degree as in other regions of the world. So in the post colonial era Africa leaders often decided to keep the same administrative borders laid out by the colonist because they didn\\'t hold as much meaning to the political realities of the continent and it would\\'ve been potentially costly to engage in what few disputes may have arisen by adjusting the sovereignty this borders afforded. On top of that the United Nations would only deal with nation-states. The option of returning to pre-colonial systems of fluid borders were no longer feasible in an international world, leaders feared another cycle of conquest if they did not nationalize. Though nationalism,  to consolidate power, was not strong.  Wars, like in Europe, were not present to bind African nations.  Also, the lack of roads and too many languages separated groups within African countries. African leaders did not have their Reconquista or 100 years war to unify tribal identities like European powers, in short. \\n These leaders would often keep the same capitals as the colonist since they were the most developed. Thus  the same problem  exists, lack of authority in the rural areas. The lack of war affected African states finances too,  Wars usually place pressure on leaders to find new and more regular sources of income, as well as make citizens more likely to allow increased taxation. If I may quote Alladin \"He who has the gold makes the rules\" is a truism of political history, African leaders often do not have the ability to buy loyalty through subsidies, thus economic incentives like industrialization and agriculture control, to better centralize a disperse population does not have the same effect.   And Solid government wages and administrative oversight do not happen often, thus corruption runs high as even leaders who do not dig unfairly into the national till have little means of stemming corruption in their borders. \\n So in short, Herbst theory which I subscribe to is about geopolitics being the main problem. African states have dispersed populations and little incentives (or ability) to strategically control the spread of the populations compared to the west, thus local authorities who may have limited interests by comparison (Mainly over their town or other small distinction) can grow powerful and fan internal strife. \\n Herbst also goes into an economic theory about how \"coin soveriegnty\" has been disasterous for west africa (see Zimbawe) and how nations that have palced more reliance on global reserve currencies have grown stronger (see Eithopia\\'s current resurgence) but that\\'s more speculative economic theory(thus ripe for political disagreement) than historical analysis.

So at least until about the 12th century, it was the European east who was more economically and culturally advanced rather than the West. \\n Of course, the Byzantine empire would lose much of its power and influence over time becoming pretty insignificant in major European affairs in its final years before being destroyed by the Ottomans. \\n Anyway, the Bulgarian state on the Balkans (as there were at least two others, one in the steppes of modern Ukraine and the Russian Black sea coast which was presumably destroyed by the Khazhars in the 7th century, and the so called Volga Bulgaria) was established in close geographical and cultural proximity to the Byzantine empire and especially after converting to christianity became a part of the Byzantine cultural world, taking up much from the Byzantine experience and know-how in state engineering and economy, which were more or less the best in Europe at the time. \\n The other significant point is that during the 8th and 9th century Bulgarian khans managed to attract much of the Slavic population of the Balkans into their realm so at the time which was a huge number for the time and by the time Bulgaria became a christian state (864 AD) its rulers controlled a vast territory with a significant population. \\n TL;DR: Bulgaria had a comparatively large population, had a strong military tradition and more importantly, learned and copied from the most advanced civilization of the time (the Byzantine empire) because the two were practically neighbours. \\n Other than these two major factors it should be noted that Constantinople was besieged many times during the Dark ages - by the Persians and Arabs in the 7th and 8th century, the Bulgarians during the 9th and 10th, the Cruzaders in 1204 and the Turks later on. Medieval warfare didn\\'t actually present \"fronts\" as we know them so armies could march deep into enemy territory. Other than that - the Bulgarian border lied about 100-120 km from the city for most of the Middle ages. So reaching the walls of Constantinople was not this big of a deal. Taking the city was, and this happened only twice in a thousand years (1204 and 1453). \\n',\n  0),\n ('It\\'s partially through design.

The PRC approached reform in a more gradual manner and left the political side of reforms out, while the Soviet Union rushed into things a bit and perhaps went too far on the political side. \\n so the Soviet Union's approach to reform was mostly overseen by Gorbachev. There had been some smaller scale experiments with some of the economic ideas that Gorbachev tried out, but they never really progressed. A certain amount of the rush to reform applied in the Gorbachev era can be attributed to the sense of stagnation that had set in from about 1970 to 1985. Initially Gorbachev's stated policy was one of 'acceleration' (uskorenie) but from about 1986 there were rumblings about Perestroika ('Restructuring') and Glasnost ('Openness'). Gorbachev's pursuit of Glasnost, which was about political reform partly because the bureaucracy was seen as part of the economic problem and partly because efficiency is in part a question of information flows. It was also certainly an ideological thing - Gorbachev was comparitively liberal and remarked on the positive values of earlier reformist movements like the Prague Spring. So what you end up with is market-style reforms, but in a fairly short period of time without a lot of preparation (politically or at the ground level) creating a lot of shocks and problems. As often happened in Soviet economic reforms one of the possible problems was it didn't go far enough - having market mechanisms in an economy that still has essentially planned components can create dysfunction. But the real problem was political - The government was coming under fire domestically for a range of reasons (economic concerns, past crimes of the state, Chernobyl etc.) and was perceived as becoming less stable which hurts peoples confidence which has real economic effects. As well as allowing such criticism, Glasnost also effectively took away the state's capacity to 'manage' these problems (mature states have other ways of dealing with this, but the Soviets were new to all this). Now add to this the break up of the Eastern Bloc, a result of the 'Sinatra Doctrine'. This was politically symbolic within the Soviet Union itself (suggesting to some weakness, to others opportunity) but also adding to economic dislocation. Some categories of industry had been fostered in the former Eastern Bloc (IIRC Bulgaria was an IT centre for example) essentially because it was integrated into the Soviet economic bloc anyway - but now those sectors were in foreign countries with governments that weren't all that keen on the Soviets. Naturally you get shortages from this, adding to popular discontent as well as adding to the economic upsets. But the best piece of evidence for it being a political crisis that tipped over the Soviet Union rather than an economic one is the chain of events that came at its end. The Gang of Eight's coup against Gorbachev wasn't  really  about economics, it was about threats to old economic power bases and fears that his policies would fragment the Union. The defiance of Yeltsin and others, first to the coup then against Gorbachev once he 'returned', similarly wasn't about economics but about opportunities for political independence (and the coup made the Union seem even less attractive out in the other union republics). \\n So tl;dr the economic reforms of Gorbachev added to a political crisis which spun out of control and took down the whole Union. \\n In the PRC on the other hand reform was a bit more gradual. Even during their earlier economic crises they had enjoyed a reasonable level of growth. The Great Leap Forward stands out as a high level of goofy policy, but during that time heavy industry of the traditional sort did continue to develop. Instead of rushing to market-style reforms you tend to find more gradualism - state industries were progressively given more responsibility, lower level local enterprise was encouraged in agriculture and light industry, such as with the Town-Village Enterprises. Eventually you have changes like the establishment of Special Economic Zones, greater reform of state enterprises and other far reaching changes - but with the groundwork having already been established. Deng Xiaoping and other reformers didn't go nearly as far with political reforms as Gorbachev did - they didn't try to change the party/state structure, and they only lifted the pressure on dissent a little bit (and when it went 'too far' they cracked down, as at Tiananmen Square). The other political element, which was perhaps external to PRC decision making to a large extent, was the foreign policy situation. The PRC could better pursue export-driven economic policy because by that stage they had fairly good relations with the US and other parts of the world. This was driven in part by a desire to play the PRC off against the Soviets. The Soviet Union tried to encourage foreign investment but didn't get nearly as positive a reception for assorted reasons. The lack of broad political reforms might have actually worked in the PRC's favour - it was seen as more stable and a safer bet than the Soviet Union, which was in a state of flux. \\n So summing up, China opted for gradualism and less political reform and probably had some advantage it terms of its access to foreign markets and hence capital for development. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('I have to forcefully disagree with you on one key point.  Bushidō was not a sacred code of honor for the samurai, and there was no widely accepted or codified set of ethical prescriptions during the sengoku period. \\n Although there were some earlier examples of attempts to promote ethical systems for warriors, these did not match modern \"bushidō\" and were not hegemonic. Most of the famous works on warrior ethics (like  Hagakure ) were written down in the 200 years of peace during the Tokugawa, by men who had never seen action on a battlefield. \\n The term bushidō itself was popularized in 1899 by Nitobe Inazō, a Christian who spent most of his time studying agriculture in Hokkaido (isolated from most of Japanese society), couldn\\'t read classical Japanese, and knew next to nothing about Japanese history.  Despite the almost complete lack of historical grounding, the concept he invented served the purposes of political leaders and nationalists very well, and became a key part of militarized nationalism around the time of the Russo-Japanese war.

Basically how it worked was each BEF regiment would be comprised of two battalions of 1000 men. One battalion would be out and about in the world and one would be home to train, send reinforcements as necessary, etc. As it were when war started half of the BEF was overseas (South Africa, Burma, India, etc.) and half were at home -- it would be 4 out of 6 of those home divisions which would be sent to France initially with the remaining 2 being sent after the Marne as their overseas brothers were filtered in gradually. \\n The  only remaining force were the Territorials^1 who had certain legal rights. They could not be sent abroad forcibly but would have to volunteer giving a \"General Service Obligation\" and they couldn\\'t be transferred from one unit to another, ie, being redeployed into the regular army to work around that. However, with that, it was an almost universal \"yes\" to go off to war when the call was made. By Christmas 1914 22 Territorial battalions were in France and by February 1915 26 more had joined them. \\n So to directly answer your question when the BEF, supplanted with the territorials and the colonials swarming in along with overseas regulars (which had Territorials going to their former posts so they could go to France), was on December 26th 1914 broken into two armies of 16 divisions from its former humble one army of 6 divisions, its existence as the professional military force that fought at Mons and Le Chateau was over. It was thoroughly filled with reservists and other forces not in the famed professional regular battalions of the pre-war era. Over the course of another year 2.2 million volunteers would continue to fill the line until, just before conscription, the British Army (still ceremoniously called the BEF) was a staggering five armies. By the end of the war, 2 million total more men would have served than would serve in WWII. \\n So, how did those reservists get into the battle then? Through just what you said -- they would be injected in small pieces at a time into existing, experienced battalions (generally to replace losses). Initially ~50 new people, comprised mostly of Senior NCO\\'s and Junior Officers^2, would be injected into an experienced battalion of 950 other men where they would be \\'hardened\\'^3. Then as privates and junior NCO\\'s (lance-corporals) filtered in in progressively small amounts they would be gradually hardened as well. They never wanted to throw a completely green battalion into the field; we must understand that these were essentially territorially raised volunteer battalions from similar walks of life. You\\'d have entire battalions of miners and laborers and you\\'d have entire battalions of clerks and businessmen; they literally banded together like that during the formation of these armies as if you could get a couple thousand people together you could say you\\'re all a battalion and there you were. \\n So the \\'Old Contemptibles\\' as they were called, those 350-400k Regulars and Territorials who held the line between August 1914 and May 1915, would be instrumental in acclimating the massive volunteer army into the realities of trench warfare until they would fade away into the mass of volunteers and later conscripts. So yes by the end of 1915 and going into \\'16 when conscription was on the horizon the volunteers of Kitcheners Army would be indistinguishable from the old BEF but still maintained their reputation amongst their peers. \\n \\n So, tl;dr: \\n \\n The original BEF + Territorials + Colonials numbered  approximately 400,000.  Half of these regulars would be overseas at wars beginning and about 50 battalions on the island were territorials who would be siphoned into the front throughout the early months of the war. So there were  ~150,000 British \\'Regulars\\'  being immediately deployed into France with  an equal amount coming to their aid  from overseas,  ~50,000+ Territorials , and  50-100k colonial forces. \\n \\n \\'Kitcheners Army\\' would raise  ~500,000 volunteers  by September 12th 1914. Many of the earliest recruits (\"the first 100,000\") would be used at Gallipoli or just generally in North Africa (Egypt, primarily) but between May-September 1915 they would mostly be gradually siphoned into Western Front, frontline duty and most would be present for the major 1915 British offensive at Loos. \\n \\n With 12,000 infantry with a total of 18,000 \\'all arms\\' (medics, engineers, etc.) to a Division there would be a total of  26 volunteer divisions  which would move to France throughout 1915 which amounted to  468,000 additional volunteers  on the Western Front in front line combat roles alone. In 1916 an additional  15 divisions, 270,000 more combat troops  would join them. \\n \\n So by mid-1916 there were on paper  ~750,000  volunteer combat troops on the front at any given time with the remainder 1.25 million volunteer troops acting as reserve, reinforcements, or more generally in noncombatant roles. \\n \\n \\n \\n Sources: \\n Martin Middlebrook,  The First Day on the Somme \\n Richard Holmes,  Tommy: The British Soldier on the Western Front \\n \\n Notes: \\n ^1 Territorials were Reservists, think National Guard if you\\'re from the United States and you\\'re almost there. \\n ^2 Because of the nature of rapid volunteering many officers were just businessmen and otherwise wealthy and literate people who elected to do so.

True, we might perhaps argue that the followers of Ghazali later interpreted his writings as anti-scientific and based their actions on such interpretations but if that\\'s you\\'re argument then you can\\'t lay the blame squarely on Ghazali.\\nIf you want to point fingers at philosophers there are probably \\'better\\' choices, like the 12th century Ibn Taymiyyah, the forefather of what centuries later would be Wahhabism (the dominant creed in modern Saudi). But even this is flawed, as with the case of Ghazali you\\'re ignoring the context of the philosopher\\'s times and environments which brought these ideas about. As cfmonkey45 says, it\\'s the decline/collapse of scientific centres such as Baghdad and Cordoba likely had a larger impact on Islamic science than any one philosopher\\'s work. \\n From u/riskbreaker2987 \\n al-Ghazali has become a popular target as the watershed for the \"end\" of the Islamic \"golden age.\" It is certainly true that, as cfmonkey45 has said, al-Ghazali strongly rejected Neoplatonist and Aristotelian philosophy that was popular amongst certain sects of Islam - the [Mu\\'tazilites]( specifically. The Mu\\'tazilites had gained significant standing in the Islamic world when they gained official court patronage in the early \\'Abbasid period, but they had been on the wane already by the time  The Incoherence of the Philosophers  debuted. It is true, though, that the work of al-Ghazali helped to kill off this ideological school. \\n As I mentioned, al-Ghazali has become a popular target over the last decade or so for the decline of Islam with regards to science, but there is an excellent - and extremely readable - argument made by Arabist Jamil Rageb for why this is simply false. Rageb also cites in the article some of these attempts to lay the blame at the feet of al-Ghazali, so that you can have a bit more of a look yourself. \\n The article: [\"When Did Islamic Science Die?

It is still not too uncommon to see words like naïve or coöperate, with a dieresis on the second of two letters indicating that it\\'s a two-syllable pronunciation of the vowels (co-op-er-ate) and not a single glide or lengthening (coo-per-ate).

Remember that the English alphabet is really the Latin alphabet with some minor modification.

For example we use <sh> for /ʃ/ instead of <š> or <ś>; We use <ni> in English for /ɲ/ (e.g. \"onion\", cf.

While, for a significant portion of its history, it was under Hapsburg (Austrian) rule and it, mostly, comprised of Germanic states it was by no accounts a unified, centralized entity. The Empire was less a unified kingdom and more a legal framework that allowed the hundreds of kingdoms developing in Central Europe to be interact with each other; the Emperor in other words was more of a mediator than a literal Emperor and as time went on that title only got less power. By its dissolution in 1806 the Emperor had nothing but symbolic importance and the Empire was little more than an amalgamation of feudal states who, more or less, agreed not to mindlessly fight each other. So when it was dissolved in 1806 by Napoleon nobody really cared; you would imagine this 1000 year old institution ending would have had this enormous uproar but it just...went away and no one batted an eye. \\n So we have this concept of a united German people arise in the middle and lower classes; let\\'s just unify right?! Not quite. After the Napoleonic Wars, at Vienna, the Great Powers wanted a balance of power in Europe; not letting any one power dominate the continent again in other words and Germany was the hot bed that had to be controlled. Austria could not act as a sole dominating actor and thus Prussia was given [a sizable piece of territory]( along with the support to counteract Austrian influence; it only helps that Prussia and the Austrians have been at odds throughout the 18th century and before. Now they were, more or less, rather equal and neither wanted to cave into control of the other. Namely because both of them had two entirely separate ideas of what \"Germany\" should be. \\n You see the Austrians wanted to go back to a quasi-HRE styled system; very decentralized with the Hapsburg king as the Emperor of this loose confederation of states while the Prussians wanted a centralized state. Even to complicate more even if Austria were to bend backward to join into Prussia\\'s dream her massive population and territory would necessitate far more influence over the matters of the state than they were willing to acquiesce. However Austria was a declining state (got absolutely ramshackled by France throughout the entire Napoleonic Wars) and Prussia had just been artificially shot into the spotlight at Vienna. \\n Prussia used this moment of power to capitalize on her influence over the Germanic states. She knew that unification was not happening this early in the ballgame and began to exert control over the states; basically an influence war broke out between the two powers as they vyed for power over the remainder of Germany through (mostly) indirect means. The Bavarians, Wurttembergers, Saxons, et. al of \"Little Germany\", ie the Southern states, were heavily catholic and more culturally aligned with the Austrians and even the French before their Prussian friends to the North while basically everyone else was up for grabs and Prussia had the perfect plan to exert her will; economic dominance. The  Zollverein , an economic Customs Union, was created and headed by Prussia which gradually included basically the entirety of all of Germany for mutual economic benefit. Well so it turns out that Prussia controlled 90% of the metallurgical and mining industry throughout Germany, 50% of the textile industry, and nearly 70% of all factory workers. \\n Thus things came to head in 1866 at last. Prussia and her allies would face up against Austria and her allies ( roughly pictured here  but would absolutely go beserk on her allies. Hanover and Hesse-Nassau (that giant swathe of land at the top there,  refer back to this map  Members had privileges including the right of free movement within the NGF, a common passport and postal system, Prussia\\'s military laws and doctrine replacing all member states, and equal religious rights. \\n The South of Germany, the orange in the most latter picture, would be gradually sucked into Prussian grasp those remaining four years between 1866 and 1870. Basically they were in an absolutely untenable position with the only reasonable solution to go into the Prussian camp or the French camp. Austria had just been mollywhooped and they can not choose to just try to maintain their independence because Prussia was threatening to cut them out of the  Zollervin  which they desperately needed; again Prussia dominated continental European industry and without those agreements for no tariffs and free economic movement and such they knew they were absolutely done for. However they could not go to France, their catholic brothers, either as Bismark quite tactfully gave France Venice on a silver platter; why would France go to war over Bavaria when the one she would go to war with was giving her everything she was asking for? By the end of 1866/early 1867 all of the remaining Southern Germanic states would sign to offensive-defensive alliances along with the agreement to cede their railroad system in event of war. \\n Baron Friedrich von Varnbuler of Wurttemberg\\'s comments show the situation best: \\n > \"Because it seemed to us to be very dangerous to be in an isolated position as a small state without the support of a Great Power even if one could assume that our neutrality is guaranteed by Europe -- which in any case is hardly likely to happen -- and as our experience with Austria make dependence on her the most thankless [option] imaginable and as reliance on France except in circumstances of exceptional necessity is contrary to national sentiment, we were obliged to conclude that the commitment entered into with Prussia corresponds with the interests . . . of Wurttemberg for it guarantees the integrity of the state.\" \\n By the Franco-Prussian War France was the only actor standing in the way of German unification. Again that whole balance of power thing; Russia had been dealt with by the threat of spreading revolution to their doorstep, Austria was just beaten in a war, and France was the only remaining power who had any stake in both keeping Germany partitioned while also being the last hope for the Bavarians especially but the rest of \"Little Germany\" with them; in fact the summer of 1870 Bavaria was reasonably on the brink of breaking ties with Prussia and maybe even war! So things were getting hot when Bismark masterfully goaded France into war and once they were absolutely smashed with their king captured and state fragmented by revolution what option did Little Germany have left other than to bow the head? Prussia economically, politically, and militarily dominated them; Bavaria would get out the most unscathed being allowed to maintain total sovereignty over her military only falling under command of the Prussian Emperor in times of war along with being on a council of equal importance to Prussia in foreign relations issues and her postal service etc. However Prussia would be the all powerful actor; her king was Emperor of Germany and the Prussian State had sole veto power over the Reichstag. \\n \\n Sorry I got into a whole spiel about German unification itself and that\\'s way off track for you. Let\\'s  TL;DR  this badboy: \\n \\n The HRE was not a centralized, \\'unified\\' Germany but a loose amalgamation of feudal states which used the Empire as a legal framework to interact with each other. By 1806 it had next to no actual significance. \\n \\n Prussia and Austria did not like each other very much and had been contesting each other for a significant amount of time. They were both made of roughly equal power after Vienna as so that not one would be able to control the entirety of Germany (hopefully) and, after 1866, after decades of economic domination Prussia would break off and wage war and win gaining total influence over what would become Germany while excluding Austria. \\n \\n A side note that I didn\\'t mention above; the top left half of Austria is ethnically German while most of it is actually not.  Only the blue on the left side of this map , red is Slovak, pink and brown are Galician, that white to the side is Transylvanian/Rumanian, the light brown near the bottom is Slovene, and the purple is Slav. Especially considering post-Seven Weeks War it became known as the Austro-Hungarian Empire it was by no means a wholistically German entity; especially by land. \\n \\n \\n',\n  0),\n ('No, people aren\\'t critical of Israel because of its positive qualities, but Israel\\'s positive qualities (a free press, high living standards, safe environment), combined with its \"war\" situation, attract lots of journalists who are free to say whatever they want about the Israeli government, meaning that there simply  is  more criticism in the press about Israel, because Israel  allows  more criticism. Journalists want to live in Israel because they have job security (everyone wants to hear about what\\'s happening) and they can have nice apartments within a quick drive to the beach, and they don\\'t really have to worry about getting shot or shelled or bombed like they would in Beirut or Baghdad. \\n Compare Israel, where thousands upon thousands of journalists live and work unmolested in Jerusalem, to Turkey. Turkey has a brutal anti-insurgency war against the Kurdish separatists in the southeast, and despite doing things that augur tons of criticism when Israel does them (clearing villages, moving the majority population in, etc.), Turkey receives very little criticism. Why? Because Turkey throws tons of journalists in jail for criticizing the government: more journalists are imprisoned in Turkey than in  China . Also, it sucks to live in Turkish Kurdistan: it\\'s a backwater shithole, so journalists, who are like the rest of us and very much enjoy having nice homes, don\\'t want to live or work there. So Turkey doesn\\'t get as much criticism as Israel does (and in fact is  praised  as a model for the Middle East) because their living standards are not attractive for journalists and they throw all the journalists who write about the Kurds in prison anyway. \\n TL;DR : Israel is a nice place to live and isn\\'t repressive, so lots of journalists like to live there and can say whatever they want without fear of being imprisoned or deported. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Most of your questions have been answered, but the \"why does it get called anti-Semitism\" hasn\\'t been answered particularly effectively.  I suspect it\\'s because they get conflated pretty easily.  Some of the more harsh criticisms of Israel can get quite close to classic anti-Semitic lingo, just with \"Jews\" replaced by \"Israelis\" or \"Zionists\", or even straight-up regurgitation of such stuff in the context of Israel (see: /r/conspiracy).  An example would be \"Israel only keeps the world\\'s support with the money they\\'ve hoarded and by scheming to manipulate other countries\".  The latter half is essentially straight out of late 1800\\'s Germany, but with the words switched.  I\\'ve also seen ridiculous a-historical claims made in that context, such as claiming that Palestinians are the original Jews and that Israelis are descendants of the Khazars, a claim which has been thoroughly disproven.  So going from one to the other does happen, and as such where exactly the border is can be difficult to pin down. \\n As for anti-Zionism, quite a bit of Israel criticism is anti-Zionist by definition.  Since Zionism is the political opinion that there ought to be a Jewish nation-state in roughly the location, the opinion that Israel should be disbanded and incorporated into Palestine is anti-Zionist.  That opinion isn\\'t significant on a national level of American politics, but it is on reddit. \\n A good example of the border being blurry is Helen Thomas\\'s controversial comments.  Essentially, she said that \"Jews need to get the hell out of Palestine and go home, to Germany, Poland, the US\".  Now, that could be seen as simple anti-Zionism.  However, it sounds like she is advocating the expulsion of millions of people to countries they fled from, and were in many cases never even citizens of.  It also shows an ignorance to the fact that a significant chunk of Israelis aren\\'t from Europe at all, and wouldn\\'t be welcome in the country their grandparents lived in.  That\\'s a pretty radical claim to make, and is something I doubt would be acceptable about any other country (saying \"the British should get the hell out of Ireland and go back to Britain\" wouldn\\'t be too popular, and in that case there is a country to easily pick out as the country to \"go back\" to). \\n tl;dr to criticism Israel without being anti-Semitic, don\\'t repeat anti-Semitic claims with the names switched, and don\\'t make claims about Israelis that you wouldn\\'t be comfortable making about other groups \\n',\n  0),\n ('Interesting. Full disclosure, I studied ninpo for four years in the Togakure-ryū style, and studied a little history with my Grandfather, a Japanese Historian. I am, however,  not  an academic. While my interest in the topic was more than casual, it did not extend into formal study. \\n What I learned doesn\\'t diverge from what you\\'re saying, but the implication has always been samurai and ninja were separate ideals. You liken it to Special Forces within a modern military, but as I understood it, it was more akin to being a mercenary (whether or not in a literal sense of the word, in the case of the ninja). Mercenaries often have military background, formal training, but they are separate entities from a national soldier. Much like ninja might have had samurai training, but did not necessarily live as samurai. They may come from the same philosophical roots, but along the road there is a divergence; namely, loyalty. Being a samurai carried with it a certain expectation of loyalty to a master (now, of course not all samurai swore fealty or were loyal, but just as in today, there is a cultural... expectation?... of what a soldier is and does), whereas being a ninja wasn\\'t about loyalty to a sworn master. Many were hired as mercenaries (something strictly forbidden by bushido code, whether or not most samurai followed that code). \\n Daisuke Togakure is credited with the first formal school, and he certainly was a fallen samurai. However, he renounced his title and the concept of bushido before beginning formalization of ninjutsu techniques. This, to me, implies an inherent difference. \\n Maybe I don\\'t understand what a samurai is. As I understand it, it\\'s more than being a soldier or a combatant, and requires a high level of social, political and noble obligation not adhered to by ninja. After all, if a daimyo was revealed as utilizing ninja, is this not dishonorable? \\n Is it a case of transformation? Do samurai  become  ninja? Or are they really both things at once? Because saying \"true ninja\" would imply there\\'s a \"true samurai\" as well, and what defines true samurai? Would it not be one who adheres to the concept of bushido, which strictly forbids several of the actions ninja partook in (mercenary work being the largest example, but is covert assassination also not territory samurai are wary to tread?)? \\n I feel like samurai and ninja are both soldiers, but in the same way the Marines and the Army aren\\'t the same thing, they overlap but are not congruent. \\n I guess I\\'m uncomfortable with the idea that I learned incorrect information in regards to something so important to me. \\n edit: it would appear as though I\\'m splitting hairs... if we assume that a ninja is technically anyone who studies ninjutsu, this would in no way bar a samurai from holding both titles, as counter-intuitive as their nature may seem. Ninjutsu doesn\\'t carry with it an innate sense of ethics the same way being a samurai does, as much as ninjutsu warfare contradicts bushido. \\n It may seem like a tall request, but I don\\'t suppose there\\'s any sources you might be able to point me towards regarding this topic specifically? This is the kind of thing it seems one would need to glean through the gaps of extensive research, but I hold out hope at least someone has compiled a more direct compendium. \\n another edit for a tl;dr: As I understand, being a samurai was not a pre-req to being a ninja, although there is significant overlap; many of the first rank and file following Togakure when he started formalization were fallen samurai, defeated in battle or having disgraced their masters. So to be a true ninja didn\\'t  require  also being a samurai, although it was certainly the truth in many cases. \\n',\n  0),\n ('A rivalry I find interesting is from early Israeli history, the Irgun/Etzel vs. the Haganah (Etzel is an acronym.  Irgun is the first word in it, but just means \"organization\", so I use Etzel.  Haganah means \"defense\", so in writing it\\'s \"the Haganah [defense]\" and \"the Irgun [organization]\" but just \"Etzel\").  They were two Jewish paramilitaries before Israel\\'s establishment, in the 30s and 40s.  Etzel broke off the Haganah.  There was also Lehi, which was even more radical and split off Etzel. \\n The Haganah was formed mostly to protect Jews from violence in the gradually climbing tensions of the 1900s between Jews and Palestinians (though that\\'s an anachronism--the contemporary terms would probably have been Jewish Palestinians and Arab or Muslim Palestinians), in which the British were often unable to intervene, or unwilling to get caught up in the conflict.  The Haganah had a strong policy of restraint, wherein they wouldn\\'t retaliate, only defend.  They also didn\\'t fight actively against the British, who they saw as partners in forming a Jewish state even when the British were somewhat reticent about Jewish settlement.  They were the ones who ran the Jewish Agency, which was sort of the proto-state apparatus that became Israel\\'s government.  David Ben-Gurion, Israel\\'s first Prime Minister, was the chair of the Jewish Agency and was pretty much running this group. \\n Etzel broke off in the 30s because they saw the Haganah is weak and ineffective.  Their ideology was Revisionist Zionism, which had been developed by Ze\\'ev Jabotinsky.  They saw the British as foreign occupiers, and therefore fought against them with much more gusto than the Haganah did (though even Etzel stopped doing so and assisted the British for the duration of WW2).  They also were much more aggressive in assisting illegal Jewish immigration to Palestine; while the Haganah tried to get the British to change to law Etzel avoided it altogether.  They also attacked Arabs in retaliation for attacks on Jews.  Interestingly, they believed the Jewish state should have the entirety of the Transjordan (modern Israel and Jordan, including the territories). \\n Each saw the other\\'s tactics as endangering the entire plan to create a Jewish state.  Etzel saw the Haganah as too weak to actually get the job of creating a Jewish state done.  The Haganah saw Etzel as fanatics and terrorists, who were in danger of getting the British to oppose the notion of a Jewish state entirely and raising the ire of the Arabs, both locally and abroad (the latter ended up happening--to what extent it was Etzel\\'s fault and to what extent it was going to happen anyway could be a book.  I tend to think a mix, but largely the latter, given events of the 20s and 30s before Etzel started fighting the British and Arabs so vociferously). \\n This led to hostilities.  At the close of WW2 in 1944, Etzel decided that the British weren\\'t worth helping anymore and resumed hostilities.  They assassinated a British official, which was the last straw for the Haganah.  They began capturing and imprisoning people from Etzel, and assisting the British in doing so.  They eventually stopped fighting outright, but the Haganah continued to oppose many of their tactics against the British and Arabs, which resulted in many deaths of people not directly involved--civilians were sometimes the targets for the Irgun (wikipedia lists some bombings of Arab markets) or weren\\'t a huge concern (as in the King David Hotel bombing, which was the HQ of the British but also had many civilians--Etzel may have called in a warning to evacuate, it\\'s still contraversial), which the Haganah especially hated.  The actual fighting started up again when the war of Independence began in earnest.  This culminated in the Altadena Affair, where an Etzel ship carrying weapons was shelled by the IDF (which at the time was still mostly just the Haganah with a new name--other groups hadn\\'t merged in yet). \\n Ze\\'ev Jabotinsky was buried in the US (the British deported him), but his will stipulated that his body should be moved to Israel under the instruction of the Israeli Prime Minister.  David Ben-Gurion disliked Jabotinsky and his ideological heirs enough to refuse to order the transfer of Jabotinsky\\'s remains.  In fact, it wasn\\'t until the 60s that Jabotinsky\\'s body was moved to Israel. \\n The rivalry lives on in politics.  After independence, the ex-Haganah people formed Mapai, which was Ben-Gurion\\'s party and was in power at first, which was Israel\\'s main left-wing party.  The ex-Etzel people formed Herut, which was Israel\\'s main right-wing party (not to be confused with a group of the same name that broke off later on).  Menachem Begin, a former leader of Etzel, was elected by them in the 70s.  Mapai merged with other parties to form Labor, and Herut merged with other parties to form Likud.  Their rivalry was intense in the early 50s (regarding reparations from Germany and economic policy) and 90s (over how to deal with the First Intifada), which died down after the assassination of Yitzchak Rabin, and the early 2000s (regarding the Second Intifada--Likud and voters didn\\'t much like Labor\\'s attempts at concessions after they failed).  It died down when a centrist party broke away from Likud called Kadima, which made coalition-building a bit more complicated but meant that there weren\\'t only two large parties in direct opposition.  They were actually in coalition together recently, until Labor split.  Recent political events, including factions breaking off, a rightward shift in Israeli politics, and other more charismatic candidates have made Labor rather weak.  Perhaps Etzel will win after all? \\n tl;dr even though they were an underground resistance movement, Zionist groups fought each other and didn\\'t give up the grudges for a long time. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"I understand it has been a long time since you posted, but I just discovered this subreddit, and I just so happen to have my first answer.

And how she could have lived during the time. \\n Your general idea of Latvians leaving because of communism is sort-of correct. But there usually were more specific ideals used as reasons to move. When the Soviet Union annexed the Baltic states, there were many beliefs from Communism that were enacted to fit the ideas of Communist society. These ideas included the general idea of a perfect, equal society. Stalinism included the belief that everyone must be equal in power for there to be a perfect society. This meant that people high in power in the Soviet Union had to be executed or removed from their state of power to become equal with the rest of Communist Society. \\n Usually, people that owned land or were high in marketing power were told of this process, and began to escape from the Soviet Union. Those that hadn't been lucky enough to have been told had to be either forced into a collective farm, or sent to a Siberian work camp to be demoted to an equal state. After all, my great-grandfather was a land-owner during the time, and was executed in the process. \\n There were also many people that simply were against the Communist ideals, and moved because of that. Especially during the Cold War, people under the Soviet control that strongly believed in the Capitalist state moved as well. \\n The fact that your grandmother moved to America would strongly show that she probably moved because she strongly believed in Capitalism, because America was practically Capitalism Headquarters. They were probably badly treated by other Americans during the 50's and 60's because tensions with the Soviet Union made Anti-Communist Robots out of most American citizens during that time. \\n Many Americans during that time, and even some organizations would frame many ex-Soviet citizens for being Communist Spies. You can read more about that by reading about the ideas of  McCarthyism ]( This would probably explain why they ended up in New Jersey instead of anywhere farther in-land. You'll usually find people who moved to America during the 50's-60's because of Communism on the East Coast. Because when they moved, they would end up in a New York/New Jersey port. Banks and Home-Owners would most likely refuse to let them have another home other than the terrible ones they were given along the ports because of their anti-communist beliefs. Chances are, your grandmother struggled in bad living conditions until the 80's. \\n You should speak to other family members for more information on their living conditions and reasons to move. All I could tell you about is the  possible  reasons and conditions. Your grandmother's could have been different. \\n TL;DR: Latvians moved mainly because of fear of execution, and anti-Soviet beliefs. They probably had bad living conditions because of anti-Communist beliefs in America, which could explain why they ended up on the East Coast. You know what? Just read the whole thing.

(I\\'m going to make some generalizations, forgive me if I stray too broad). \\n Edit:  forgot the 20-year rule \\n A  state , to borrow Max Weber\\'s definition (which in many social sciences is a standard definition), is the institution which has a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence in a given territory [[1]]( This usually means the state is the army and police, but also the taxation system to fund those organizations and the government to decide how they are used. A state, therefore, is a set of institutions: The government, the bureaucracy, etc. \\n A  nation , in contrast, is a group of people who feel bound to each other into a collective by something shared, like religion, ethnicity, language, or other cultural elements. Benedict Anderson defines it as \"an imagined political community\" though with the caveat that he does so in the middle of a few paragraphs wherein he explains that it\\'s a very tricky thing to pin down with a precise definition [[2]]( \\n So, these terms aren\\'t immediately clear, and in fact \"nation,\" \"country,\" \"state,\" \"nation-state,\" etc are often used interchangeably all the time by laymen and even journalists, leading to quite a bit of confusion about what each one means. Let\\'s look at some examples: \\n A good example of a  nation  is the Jewish people. Though several times throughout their history they have had a state (\"Israel\"), for most of their history they have not, and they have maintained a shared tradition, religion, ethnic identity, and even some elements of language. During the Jewish Diaspora after the Roman annexation of Judea, Jews scattered throughout the world, not belonging to any particular state: they lived in the Roman Empire, Persia, China, and in the Middle ages throughout the many different Christian polities of Europe as well as throughout the middle east. Through this time they formed communities, often segregated either voluntarily or by force from other inhabitants of their homes, and they maintained an identity and shared recognition as a people, a \"nation,\" adrift in the world. I\\'ll come back with a few more examples after discussing states. \\n States , in one form or another, are much more pervasive. The simplest form of a state is a  sedentary bandit . One obviously sees this structure copied across the world for most of recorded history: settled civilizations generally have a government (be it monarchy, oligarchy, republic, democracy, etc.), a means of commanding and supplying a military force, and a system of taxation or tribute in order to pay for that military. Clearly most states have found it prudent to go beyond this basic formula, and often create laws, establish order, promote particular religious beliefs, and provide services back to the people (infrastructure, education, health, etc). The usual date for the beginning of the \"modern\" idea of the state is the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, in which it was agreed by all the major European powers that states were sovereign, and that it is not the place of one state to interfere in the internal affairs of another. \\n So to return to the Jewish example, Jews at one point were in possession of a  state  of Israel, had their own kings, soldiers, and system of taxes and tributes. When they were conquered at various points (by Babylonians, Romans etc) the  state  was conquered and destroyed, but the  nation  persisted: the Jews kept on thinking of themselves as a people with a shared history, culture, religion and identity, and whether they were captives in Egypt or Babylon or adrift in the Roman empire (other  states ), they would remain a  nation . Does this example make sense? When Israel was re-established as a state in the 20th century, the \"nation of Israel\" finally had a \"state of Israel\" to go \"home\" to. \\n In the modern world, you often see Nations and States come in various combinations. Some nations are spread across multiple states: the German \"nation\" between the World  Wars was (in one conception) spread throughout Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, etc., and Hitler agitated that the entire German Nation should be united under the German State. Other times, one state contains several different nations: Spain, for example, contains Castillians, Basques, Catalans and others, and many Basques and Catalans feel that they are separate nations and should have their own states. The United States federal government is a State, under whose authority there are 50 \"states\", and much of the history of the US has been to meld together different immigrant groups and conquered peoples into one American \"nation\". The whole \"melting pot\" analogy is a classic attempt at \"nationbuilding\": trying to create shared values and traditions in order to bring different groups of people into one community.  Putin\\'s rationale for interference in Ukraine is based on the idea that the Russian residents there belong to the greater Russian Nation and should thus be re-incorporated into the mother country.  This general process of trying to patch together \"lost\" or \"separated\" pieces of a nation is called \"irredentism\". Sometimes, nations/states get very lucky and the borders of the nation line up very closely with the border of a nation. Portugal is a classic example: Portugal is pretty much just Portuguese people (aside from immigrants of course); France is up there as a pretty good one. Other nations like Yugoslavia got so unlucky that they were torn apart by nationalist forces. Some states (like Syria or Iraq) are just carved out on a map and governments are forced to try to create a nation out of thin air by cobbling together a diverse group of people, many of whom have state aspirations of their own (like Kurds). Benedict Anderson gives the example of Siam as just something left over: it became a country just because everything around it was partitioned off into colonies! \\n Anyway, to the point:  why was France the first modern Nation? That claim is a very contestable one, and I\\'d like to see what /u/SanatKumara is using to back that up,  but usually the claim dates to the French Revolution in 1789 in which the National Assembly declared France to be a nation and a state, or two years later in which the people of France (all adult males) elected a National Convention as its governing body, and perhaps further in 1793 when the convention ordered the mass mobilization of the entire French population to defend the country:\\n>From this moment until such time as its enemies shall have been driven from the soil of the Republic all Frenchmen are in permanent requisition for the services of the armies. The young men shall fight; the married men shall forge arms and transport provisions; the women shall make tents and clothes and shall serve in the hospitals; the children shall turn linen into lint; the old men shall betake themselves to the public squares in order to arouse the courage of the warriors and preach hatred of kings and the unity of the Republic\" \\n Placing an exact date on the idea is difficult, but what one can safely conclude is that whereas France had been a state for centuries, it had been a monarchical state owned, as it were, by the king (Louis XIV famously declared \"I am the state\"). In the Revolution, with the institution of a Republic, the people of France laid claim to the state, and by serving in the military  en masse  to defend the country, established that the French State and French Nation are one and the same, thus the modern Nation-State was born. \\n Please let me know if I can explain anything further! \\n TL;DR : Nations are groups of people with a shared identity. States are institutions like governments. When a discrete group of people has its own state, that\\'s called a \"nation-state\". France was arguably (though very contestably) the first modern nation-state. \\n',\n  0),\n ('In Belgium, one might consider Flanders and Wallonia to be different nations, united in one state. \\n Two years ago, the Flemish government proposed a \"Handvest voor Vlaanderen\" (which might be translated as a \"Charter for Flanders\").

It\\'s hard to define what a \"culture\" is, but some interesting points: \\n \\n Media (TV, radio, newspapers): all (large) TV/radio channels and newspapers are either Flemish or Francophone, none are shared between both parts of the country. Also, TV from France is quite popular in Wallonia. \\n Books: because of the language it\\'s common for Flemish people to read books by both Flemish and Dutch authors, next to translations of any other language (whether by authors from Wallonia, the UK, or the US). \\n Popular culture such as music or movies: there might be a divide between Flanders and Wallonia here, but much smaller than in the case of books. (This is directly related to the fact that language doesn\\'t play such a large factor in these cases.) \\n Economically there are large differences between Flanders and Wallonia (e.g. lower unemployment rates in Flanders); however there are also differences between the provinces within each region, between cities and countryside, between age groups, etc... \\n Political parties: there are (almost) no political parties that are \"Belgian\", all are separated between Flanders and Wallonia/the others. E.g. there are Flemish socialists and Francophone socialists, Flemish and Francophone liberals, etc. There are some \"national\" parties, but these are fringe parties. \\n Also politically, there are clear differences between voting patterns in Flanders (right-wing) and Wallonia (left-wing). Although on the other hand, even within Flanders there are large differences (e.g. more left-wing in the cities). I think this is a result of differences in economy, in politic parties, but also in media leading to different formation of a \"public opinion\" (different TV debates and news reports, different \\'opinion pages\\' in the papers). \\n Belgian folklore, such as the Belgian beers, chocolate, and fries, are shared and not specific to one group. \\n The existence of the word \"Flemish\" in \"Flemish people\", \"Flemish media\", \"Flemish culture\"... (and the usage of these words by these people) means they consider themselves Flemish, so they consider themselves a nation under the definition given above (maybe without knowing). There has also been debate among Flemish people whether we feel \"Flemish\" or \"Belgian\" or \"European\", or maybe \"Flemish first but also Belgian\", or \"Flemish in Europe\", or even \"citizen of my town first, Belgian second\". There are many opinions on this. \\n There does  not  officially exist a Flemish (sub)nationality. Flemish people have a Belgian passport, i.e. with Belgian nationality.  Technically , someone is Flemish if they are Belgian and their official residence is in Flanders. However, some people might feel Flemish even though they\\'re Belgian but living in Wallonia; others might be Belgian, living in Flanders, but speak French and feel Wallonian even though they officially are Flemish. \\n \\n Also note that much of this has been a progression (as Belgium moved from a unitary to a federal state between 1970 and 1993): once parties were nationalized, at a certain point they split; the national radio and television used (BRT in Dutch and RTB in French—for Belgian Radio and Television) to be national but split into VRT (Flemish Radio and Television) and RTBF (Radio Télévision Belge Francophone), and so on. So while Flanders might be considered a nation at this point, it possibly wasn\\'t in 1830 when Belgium was founded. \\n tl;dr: Flanders is considered a nation by its politicians. There are bunch of arguments for this, but OTOH \"Flemish culture\"/\"Xish culture\" and feelings of people are impossible to strictly define. Also, nations can gradually appear and disappear. And, possibly, people can feel like they belong to more than one culture or nation at the same time. \\n',\n  0),\n ('The plan was hyper ambitious in scope and was a gamble in every sense of the word; as it sent the bulk of the OKW\\'s (West) relatively intact and whole formations, that would be  Kampfwert I  (\"Capable of all operations\") units against the US 12th Army Group. All warfare at some point requires gambling, but  in hindsight  it would\\'ve been wiser for the Germans to have folder rather than go all-in in December 1944. The failure of the Ardennes offensive left very little mobile units to stop the Ruhr from falling rapidly in 1945. \\n Wacht am Rhein had key flaws in its strategic planning, first off it was ambitious in scope. The plan was to split the 12th and 21st Army Groups by securing Antwerp; this involved a drive of considerable distance as well as crossing a river obstacle - the Meuse. The ambitious scope of the plan is brought home when its stressed that the German planners actually tried to factor in  captured  fuel into the equation. A reliance on the procurement of enemy fuel is a dangerous logistical trap to fall into; and it had bit the Germans in the butt more than once during their attacks and drives towards the Alamein line in 1942. Not only was it a gamble, it was a gamble that had not gone well for them before; and it was by no means necessary, as these excellent formations could\\'ve held the Rhineland for a considerable scope of time  if we use the failure of Operation Queen as evidence. \\n Hitler\\'s expectations in the event of success were...argubly in the realm of fantasy as well. The hope was to drive one Ally or the other out of the war, or at least to the bargaining table, in the event of the seizure of Antwerp. Given that the Americans and the British had just waged 2 years of global coalition warfare with only the pettiest of arguments and friction, to think this would have rent the alliance asunder is laughable. Make no doubt, it would\\'ve been a massive strategic set back for the Allies, and may have prolonged the war. \\n The reason the initial attacks were so violent and successful was that the Allied 12th Army group was stretched thin, and with no reserves. The US V Corps was thus ruptured rapidly and the Americans had no mobile reserves  immediately  to hand to blunt or seal off the penetration. The entire situation was without a doubt exacerbated by the Allied perception that the Germans were not capable of large-scale counteroffensives, and it was something of a successful deception by the Germans. [As you can see]( the initial attacks on Dec. 16th didn\\'t take a fantastic amount of ground, and were actually considered simply local attacks by Allied command. Many units on the flanks to the North, for example, were not given warning orders about the enemy offensive until the 18th-20th of December. A considerable amount of time for the Germans to exploit local superiority. \\n Gen. Bradley, once the scale of the situation became apparent, reacted by shifting the lightly engaged 3rd Army North, and the 9th Army south, to attack the flanks of the penetration. The US VII Corps, with both of the US Heavy Armored Divisions, stopped the 2.Panzer (at this point running out of gas) short of the Meuse, and annihilated it. The move was basically done around the clock and through the night to get into contact with the enemy as rapidly as possible; and Gen. Collins (VII Corps commander) deserves credit for allowing his Armored units to react to situations as they developed rather than give them stiff orders and Limits of Advance. The reaction was greatly aided by the key road junction of Bastogne not being fully secured by the German advance; which greatly hampered the distribution of fuel to the leading German formations. Gen. Bradley also made the important decision of handing over tactical control of the 9th Army to the 21st Army Group - Gen. Montgomery\\'s command - which eased command and control burdens, allowed him to concentrate on a smaller section of the front, and allowed the US Ninth army to cross now non-existent boundaries between corps and armies. The TLDR of this means that the reaction to the enemy attack did not result in friendly fire, traffic jams, and interlocking units. It was a small correction, but a key one. It also meant the 21st Army Group, not heavily engaged at all in this time, could take over more of the front; the American front could therefore  shorten  enough to allow an entire Corps - the VII to turn around and rush to cut off the German advance. \\n',\n  0),\n ('> Many cited the introduction of plate armor, the pre-eminence of personal firearms and the decline in hobby archery as reasons.

That aside, there are differences between colonial slavery and Roman slavery. \\n Romans  were  fairly egalitarian in who they took into bondage. Anyone they could defeat in battle was a potential slave and melanin didn\\'t really come into the equation. Rome contained middle eastern slaves, African slaves, Macedonian slaves, Northern European slaves, Balkan slaves and so on. With that being the case, it could be difficult to distinguish a slave from a citizen based solely on their appearance. \\n Many generations later, it is impossible. Most modern Italians probably have a good deal of \"slave blood\" in their veins and don\\'t even know it. \\n Colonialism also played a big role. Roman slaves stayed \"in the neighborhood\" of their homeland both in terms of geography and culturally. A Roman senator might simultaneously have a Gallic slave and a Gallic wife and a Gallic business partner, for example, which would have some effect on how he treated the Gallic slave. And it would change the slave\\'s perception of himself, knowing that not all Gauls were in bondage. \\n This was not the case in many colonial societies, where Africans exclusively were slaves. Then skintone becomes an obvious delineation between groups with all the attendant taboos about marriage or social promotion or whatever. \\n TL;DR: With stars upon thars, slave populations will integrate much more quickly into their larger society. \\n',\n  0),\n ('I doubt anyone with a realistic idea of the size of the world has ever seriously considered trying to conquer it.

There was a marked upswing in moralising art from the likes of William Hogarth and Augustus Egg; serial narratives spanning several paintings such as  A Harlot\\'s Progress  ([1]( [2]( [3]( [4]( [5]( [6]( or  Past and Present  ([1]( [2]( [3]( would present cautionary tales to the viewer, while stuff like *[Gin Lane/Beer Street]( tried to guide viewers onto the \"correct\" path. At the same time, there was still veneration of the ideal beauty that could be found in the works of the \"Old Masters\" of the Renaissance - Raphael, Michelangelo, Giorgione, Titian, etc. \\n [Olympia]( was a slap in the face to the moralisers of the time, and it used the tools of the Old Masters to accomplish it. It took a well-known and beloved work by Titian, the  Venus of Urbino . Lip service might be paid to her being a classical goddess, but realistically this is meant to be sensual, her nudity erotic. \\n Olympia  on the other hand isn\\'t a lover but a prostitute. Her gaze is frank and her posture challenging. For her, nakedness is just part of a job, the bed a workplace. Where Venus is brushing (toying with?) her pubis, Olympia is firmly covering and protecting hers. The flowers are a gift from a patron (perhaps the viewer themselves) and it\\'s pretty clear she doesn\\'t much care for them one way or the other. You can\\'t buy her affection with pretty baubles like the Venus, you buy her body and nothing more. At her feet, a black cat with its hackles raised, also staring at the viewer - there are many iconographic interpretations for this element, but at the very least it\\'s there to make it damned clear just who the interloper is in this situation. And while the cat might be disconcerting to avid symbolists, it pales in comparison to the overall impression taken away by the average Victorian viewer of the piece as a whole. Here is an independent woman who, in contrast to the \"virginal ideal\" placed upon women at the time, is firmly in control of her sexuality, using it to her own advantage and to put her in a dominant position over men (she\\'s not being pimped here, she\\'s a courtesan who chooses her engagements). And  worse , she\\'s successful at it. This is no \"fallen woman\" to be pitied. You only need to look at the rich draperies, the expensive orchid in her hair and the jewellery she\\'s wearing -  the fact she has a servant  - to see that she\\'s no ten-penny whore. This at a time when there was much public discussion and controversy going on over the place of prostitution in society as a whole, and Parisian society in particular. Something that made prostitution seem  appealing and empowering  was only ever going to add more fuel to the fire. Manet knew the painting was going to be controversial - he kept it hidden for over two years while deciding what to do with it. \\n When it was finally put on display,  Olympia  drew fire from critics and outrage from the public pretty much instantly. Not on aesthetic grounds, but for the way it portrayed its subject. It was described as \"art that has sunk so low it is not worthy of our censure\", showing \"scandal and idol, power and public presence of Society’s wretched secret, [...] the primitive barbarity and ritual animality in the customs and practices of urban prostitution\". They said of its exhibition that \"if the canvas of the Olympia was not destroyed, it is only because of the precautions taken by the administration.\" Manet was airing the country\\'s dirty laundry to anyone who wanted to gawk at it.  Olympia  refuses to be anyone\\'s dirty little secret, she makes no effort to conceal who and what she is. She stares outward at the viewer and says \"so what?\" \\n This frank approach to the depiction of women was taking off in other circles too, during the transition from Romanticism to Realism. And pretty much anywhere it was going on, there were people complaining about it. Take a look at Millais\\'  [Christ in the House of his Parents]( What do you think was the most-discussed aspect of the piece at the time? The symbolism? The style? The subject matter? Nope - what drew most comment was the artist\\'s choice to portray the Holy Family as actual human beings, and not sculpted Romantic beauties. Charles Dickens himself called Millais out for portraying Mary as being \"so hideous in her ugliness that [...] she would stand out from the rest of the company as a Monster in the vilest cabaret in France, or the lowest gin-shop in England.\" People went  on* to discuss the other issues raised by the piece and the ideals of the Pre-Raphaelite movement as a whole, but the opening salvo was entirely at this \"warts and all\" aesthetic. \\n Tl;Dr:  Victorians didn\\'t like it when art showed women as human beings that didn\\'t fall neatly into the categories of \"virginal and virtuous woman to be worshipped and admired\" or \"fallen woman to be pitied and scorned\". \\n For more stuff on depictions of women in the 19th century, one of the better books out there is Bullen\\'s  The Pre-Raphaelite Body , which goes into exactly this sort of schism. \\n',\n  0),\n ('I can\\'t agree more.

Any artillery, escape routs, how much food and water they possessed, ect. ect. \\n When the actual siege commenced, the attacking army would set up long-term and well guarded camps outside the city walls. It's not like in the movies where the army just stands there holding their spears for three months. They surround the walls, and prepare for long-term survival. \\n The attacking army will usually have one of two goals: \\n 1: Destroy the walls, wipe the enemy off the map. This is common when the attackers have a specific target, such as killing a king. \\n 2: Take the city. This is when things get long, spanning over months or even years. They have to starve out the population until they either surrender or die. If the city surrenders and joins the attacking faction, all the better for them. \\n When destruction is the objective, siege equipment and lines of archers will be the name of the game. Catapults, trebuchets, battering rams, even siege towers. In the beginning of the battle, the attacker's catapults and archers will fire into the city, catapults targeting the towers or the city's own artillery. Archers will target enemy infantry if they're attempting to return fire, otherwise they will rain flaming arrows in an attempt to burn down wooden homes and other buildings. There's also the ladders and siege towers, which would be used to get your soldiers onto the enemy walls to take out their archers. \\n Once the city stops returning fire due to retreat or running out of ammo or soldiers, the attacker will send in the battering ram. Of course there would be situations of the ram being used earlier than this, but it was an uncommon tactic due to leaving your soldiers in the open as you attempt to break down the city gates. \\n Gotta TL;DR from here as I don't have any more time.

The Founders were big fans of John Locke. \\n I\\'ll back up a little. \\n The Enlightenment was the outgrowth of the separation of church and state, first in German-speaking Europe and later (1680s) in England. With this came the demise of the Divine Right of Kings and the emergence of the notion that the right to wield power by anyone over a population came from the people, rather than from God. \\n This gives rise to the notion of a social contract. Hobbes writes Leviathan in 1651, and he maintains that sovereignty (the right to hold power) comes from the people, but he\\'s still a proponent of absolute monarchy. When Locke comes along 35 years or so later, he\\'s writing in defense of the Glorious Revolution, in which James II, a Catholic, is deposed in favor of the Protestant William and Mary. So he has to argue (in his Second Treatise on Government) that the people hold the right to throw off oppressive rule. Which he does argue. \\n This would be a difficult argument to make had it not already been somewhat established that sovereignty came from the people and not elsewhere (God, heredity, etc.). And it would have been hard to deny the Divine Right of Kings in general had the division between politics and faith already begun. \\n Jefferson, in particular, was a close reader of Locke. So, e.g., when you look at the Declaration of Independence, a few things from Locke jump right out. For one, the phrase \"life, liberty and pursuit of happiness\" is cribbed from Locke\\'s own \"life, liberty, and property,\" which are the three things Locke says government is required to protect. Also, the list of grievances in the Declaration is based on Locke\\'s notion that revolution was only called for when the infractions of government were severe and went on for a long time. \\n Another thing: Locke is a stickler for the notion that there is no taxation without representation. Obviously, this is the core complaint of the Revolution, but it crops up in the Constitution in a few ways. First, only the House of Representatives can spend money or levy taxes, and that\\'s why it\\'s up for election every two years — otherwise, Locke\\'s conditions for proper popular consent to taxation wouldn\\'t be met. \\n Moreover, you see the phrase \"Indians not taxed\" in the Constitution a few times. It\\'s there to emphasize that while Indians are not being afforded the rights and protection of the Constitution, it\\'s OK (they believed) because they\\'re not being taxed, so it can\\'t be said that a core principle of Locke\\'s is being violated. \\n tl;dr - two words: John Locke \\n',\n  0),\n ('The first thing that I will say might sound a little familiar: John Locke.  He’s just essential to understanding the American governmental system, since many of the founders’ ideas were lifted from Locke’s  Second Treatise on Government. \\n It wouldn’t be very interesting or useful to just rehash aemathisphd’s post, though, so I’ll go ahead and try to answer the first question: how the Enlightenment effected the American Revolution.  The short answer, unfortunately, is that it is impossible to tell.  Many recent historians, who seek to remove the ‘Founding Fathers’ from their pedestal, look for alternative motives for the Revolution, and economic motives are very convincing.  Americans had been paying greatly reduced taxes compared to citizens within England proper, and had prospered greatly as a result.  Following the French and Indian War, the Crown needed to make up some of the debt accrued, and so it looked to the colonies it had just defended in a costly military campaign.  The colonists ardently opposed these taxes (which were onerous compared to the old tax rate, but not any worse than in England) on the basis that there should be “no taxation without representation.” \\n Unfortunately, this leads into a tangential argument about whether or not the colonists were represented.  According to the theory of ‘virtual representation’, each member of the British Parliament represented the interests of all members of the British Empire.  Despite that all who sat in Parliament were chosen from people who lived in England proper, it was expected that they were disinterested enough to competently handle the affairs of all citizens across the globe. \\n Naturally, the colonists didn’t buy this argument, and so due to a difference in definitions of the term ‘representation’, the colonists believed they were being unjustly taxed and proceeded to revolt.  Here ends the (short) telling of the economic explanation of the American Revolution. \\n What is more interesting to study, then, is the Enlightenment  justification  for the American Revolution.  Certainly the first point to be made is Locke’s theory of representative taxation, since that is both a philosophical and an economic argument.  This was not the only rationale, though, and the discussion of an alternate explanation may also shed some light on the emergence of American exceptionalism theory. \\n American colonists believed they were fundamentally more civilized than Europeans.  Now, this is a bold claim, so what does it mean?  During the time of the Enlightenment, there emerges this new importance on the idea of civility, of refinement, that came to dominate European intellectual life.  One of the more radical ideas of the eighteenth century was the idea that people are fundamentally equal.  [Critics will quibble that ‘people’ here means ‘white male landowners’ but I’ll ignore that for the moment.  Others will argue that Hobbes originates this idea of equality in the seventeenth century.  To them I say: touché.]  The implication of this idea of equality is, of course, that class divisions in society should be made on the basis of talent, rather than lineage (Jefferson would call the newly created upper class the ‘natural aristocrats’).   This idea was music to the ears of the colonists, who as a general rule were not of noble birth.  As Gordon Wood states, “because [the founders] were men of high ambition and yet of relatively modest origins, they naturally were eager to promote the new enlightened standards of gentility and learning in opposition to the traditional importance of family and blood… aristocrats who measured their status not by birth or family but by enlightened values and benevolent behavior.”  ( The Idea of America , 277)  It’s why Benjamin Rush, among others, pushed so hard for a public school system to be instituted: by adopting and embracing this Enlightenment ideal of, well, enlightenment, America could be transformed from a backwater colony into a burgeoning nation that represented the height of civility.  It was a huge turnaround: our good friend John Locke famously said “in the beginning all the world was America” and scarcely a hundred years later the colonists were vying for a place in the global order. \\n What does this mean for American exceptionalism?  Well, because it was the first country that had no aristocratic class, it was arguably the first that was founded on Enlightenment ideals.  It ignores the ingrained prejudices of the Old World and adopts the high standard of living that was formerly reserved for nobility.  There was no reason to remain a part of the British Empire if America had achieved independently what Europe could still not implement, and so the Revolution was seen as the natural conclusion to the evolution of America.\\nIn order for it to stick, though, the founders had to create a government based on Enlightenment ideals that was amenable to all parties.  The logical conclusion of the Enlightenment is a global community, one rooted in rationalism and a respect for minor differences due to a common belief in what is best for society.  Americans sought to do this first in the realm of religion: by making America an explicitly secular society, religions would be allowed to flourish but (theoretically) prevented from having a controlling interest in governance.  The original politicians were drawn largely from plantation owners and retired businessmen; this was because financial independence was necessary to allow for a degree of  disinterestedness .  It was possible to have a religion, or to be involved in a trade, or to have desires, but choosing politicians who were wealthy meant that they wouldn’t be as likely to let their self-interest guide their decisions.  (Adam Smith would discuss this concept in  The Wealth of Nations .)  The Constitution would repeat this idea again and again: no one group should have a controlling interest.  Balance of powers, restrictions, enumerated responsibilities; all were in the interest of creating a rational constitution that would uphold this ideal of disinterested governance. \\n And so, Americans saw themselves as exceptional.  Theirs was a logical constitution, derived from the writings of the  philosophes  and from John Locke.  Theirs was a revolution that (at least rhetorically) defended the principles of the Enlightenment, that acknowledged the equality of individuals and the right of self-governance.  Theirs was the success of education free from the fetters of a traditional aristocratic class or the restrictions of European society.  Since this idea of exceptionalism has been widely questioned by several individuals (most recently by Vladimir Putin), it would be interesting to discuss it from a historical point of view in your class and debate on whether the argument that America is exceptional was ever valid and, if so, whether it still is. \\n For further reading, if you’re interested, I’d strongly suggest Gordon Wood’s essay on the Enlightenment in  The Idea of America .  Though it speaks more to the effect of the Enlightenment on American society than creating a causal link with the Revolution, it is very well researched and written. \\n tl;dr – cause: economics. justification: refinement, rationalism, exceptionalism \\n',\n  0),\n (\"No. Some of the historiography tries to emphasis this aspect, but its often done in ignorance of the wider changes in tactics & conceptualisation of warfare. Ideas that the Canadians/ ANZACs were the only ones to practice 'mission command' or a limited form of fire and manoeuvre with independent sections/platoons are often argued in ignorance of the fact that the official documents they cite are British, and were often drawn from French and German documentation. they practiced standard tactics, utilised the same weapons and were tied to a wider similar conceptualisation of warfare. \\n The only reasonable argument that could support such a statement would derive from the rapid relief of Canadian/ANZACs post-battle. This allowed them to analyse and integrate 'lessons learned' together with casualty replacements more rapidly than other formations, which were often left in the line longer and thus lost the possibility for reflection in the pursuit of more pragmatic immediate concerns. Additionally these lessons learned were also rapidly distributed to other formations via memos, pamphlets, etc.. The only edge here, I would argue, is better opportunities to integrate these lessons learnt, and this depended a great deal upon the tempo of operations allowing for withdrawal and rest. such opportunities existed from 1915-mid 1918 before the tempo of operations rose alarming in the 100 day offensive. \\n TL:DR better tactics, no. better practised tactics, possibly but limited in its effects. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"hi! you'll find lots of info on the Gregorian calendar in the FAQ (link on sidebar) - including a cool /r/AskHistorians podcast. TL;DR: the calendar wasn't introduced until a few hundred years later :) \\n [How did the world agree on what year it is?]( \\n\",\n  0),\n ('I think you need to consider the context of the disagreement between Lemon and Hoff Sommers to really make sense of the issue.  To start, neither of these two women are historians - Lemon is a professor of  law  at Berkely, where she\\'s a widely respected authority on Domestic Violence law, while Hoff Sommers is a philosophy phd whose main activity these days is writing right wing  political  tracts for the American Enterprise Institute.  So strictly speaking, the argument they\\'re having about the \"rule of thumb\" isn\\'t a historical one - rather, what you\\'re looking at is a feminist legal scholar and an anti-feminist ideologue who are arguing over the existence of the  concept  of the rule of thumb.  And on that point - whatever historical errors might have crept into Lemon\\'s argument - I think Sommers largely failed in her bid to discredit Lemon\\'s scholarship. \\n Let\\'s start by looking at the claim that Hoff Sommer\\'s originally made: the controversy starts with an article she wrote in the  Chronicle of Higher Education,  called [\"Persistent Myths in Feminist Scholarship,\"]( in which Hoff Sommers quotes the claim in Lemon\\'s book: \\n >\"The history of women\\'s abuse began over 2,700 years ago in the year 753 BC. It was during the reign of Romulus of Rome that wife abuse was accepted and condoned under the Laws of Chastisement. ... The laws permitted a man to beat his wife with a rod or switch so long as its circumference was no greater than the girth of the base of the man\\'s right thumb. The law became commonly know as \\'The Rule of Thumb.\\' These laws established a tradition which was perpetuated in English Common Law in most of Europe.\" \\n and makes the argument that: \\n >The phrase \"rule of thumb\" did not originate with any law about wife beating, nor has anyone ever been able to locate any such law. It is now widely regarded as a myth, even among feminist professors. \\n Let\\'s start by clearly the air a bit:  Yes, Lemon\\'s book was incorrect to suggest that Romulus was anything more than a mythical figure, or that we can trace the origin of the alleged \"rule of thumb\" to ancient rome.  The problem is that Sommers used this error to try to discredit Lemon\\'s  entire argument,  using it to go on a bit of a rant (seriously, read the link) about feminist legal scholarship, about feminism more generally, and to launch personal attacks against Lemon - where in reality the ancient roman connection is kind of incidental to the book\\'s larger point, which is that for much of history, there  really was  a legal doctrine supporting husbands\\' right to \"moderately\" punish or beat their wives.  This doctrine wasn\\'t always supported by judicial decisions or by legislation, but there\\'s a great deal of evidence suggesting that it was  customary  and widespread - and the key point here is that  we know it existed  - something which Sommers appears to be trying to deny. \\n When we look at the actual evidence, we find that the  idea  of something like a \"rule of thumb\" is actually persistently (though often obliquely) brought up again and again in legal history. \\n Blackstone\\'s  Commentaries on the Laws of England  (mid-1700s) state that \"by the old law\" \\n >The Husband might give his wife moderate correction. For, as he is to answer for her misbehavior, the law thought it reasonable to intrust him with this power of restraining her, by domestic chastisement, in the same moderation that a man is allowed to correct his apprentices or children... but this power of correction was confined within reasonable bounds. \\n Pointedly, Blackstone also asserts that \\n >With us, in the politer reign of Charles the Second, this power of correction began to be doubted, and a wife may now have security of the peace against her husband. \\n But the point here is that Blackstone was acknowledging the existence of a doctrine of \"moderate correction\" under the  old  laws.  And he also qualifies this by noting that: \\n >Yet the lower rank of people, who were always fond of the old common law, still claim and exert their ancient privilege; and the courts of law wills till permit a husband to restrain a wife of her liberty, in case of any gross misbehavior. \\n So while Blackstone appears to be denying that something like the \"rule of thumb\" is actually \"on the books,\" he\\'s also explicitly acknowledging that it  was  on the books in earlier years, and that many people still regard it as legitimate. \\n Bacon\\'s \"New Abridgment of the Laws\" (1736) actually suggests that something resembling the existence of a doctrine of moderate correction  is  law; \\n >The Husband hath by law Power and Dominion over his Wife, and may keep her by Force within the Bounds of Duty, and may beat her, but not in violent or cruel manner. \\n Note that later editions and copies of Bacon disagree over whether or not this included husbands\\' right to violently beat their wives, or whether this doctrine applied in the US or England - some reprints and editors accept it, others don\\'t.  The point is that it\\'s  being debated  - which means that at least some judges and individuals were at least trying to apply it. \\n Legal scholar Henry A. Kelly [has analyzed the evidence for a \"rule of thumb\" at length,]( and while he concludes that there was no \"actual\" law or rule about the rule of thumb, he also finds a great deal of evidence that the  idea  of it was widely and continually brought up in legal cases and legal literature, both in England and in the Americas. \\n Kelly found a decision in England from 1778, for example, in which a judge told the court that \"a husband could thrash his wife with impunity provided that the stick was no bigger than his thumb.\"  And he does not question that \"the doctrine that moderate chastisement means moderate beating\" surfaces frequently in english and american legal history.  Take, for example, his analysis of nineteenth century American court cases, in which he suggests that judges who made statements about how the notion that \"a rod which may be drawn through the wedding ring is  not now  deemed necessary to teach the wife her duty and subjection to the husband\" is actually pretty clear evidence that \" there was  a belief that husbands had a right to use a small switch on their wives,\" and that \" there was  such a belief about the wedding ring being the measure of a rod that could by custom be used against her.\" \\n The point here is that while Lemon is clearly incorrect about Romulus, and while Sommers\\' assertion that there\\'s no \"actual law\" about the rule of thumb is essentially correct, she\\'s committing a pretty egregious academic sin herself in trying to use this as a \"gotcha\" to discredit Lemon\\'s scholarship, and feminist scholarship more generally.  The historical evidence suggests that something resembling the rule of thumb was a pretty constant presence in Anglo-American culture - and the fact that we can find scholars and judges arguing about it or referencing it is a sign that this isn\\'t something which modern-day feminists have made up, which is what Sommers seems to want to argue. \\n As far as the \"rule of thumb\" is concerned, I think [Tom Tyler]( puts it quite neatly: \\n >irrespective of whether this practice was officially sanctioned by \\nlaw, it is clear there certainly existed a popular belief that, within these \\n\"reasonable\" limits, wife-beating was tolerable. Thus, although the origin \\nof the perfectly innocent phrase \"rule of thumb\" does not lie with violent \\nabuse, it seems that the thumb was perceived as a de facto standard in this \\nregard. \\n So in answer to your question, I would just say that as someone who is interested in history and is getting into legal scholarship, you should be prepared for this kind of \"bad\" history to surface  a lot  - judges and legal scholars are not historians, and they get stuff \"wrong\" about history  constantly.   Obviously, the \"history\" part of Lemon\\'s book is not its primary focus or its strong point - but Hoff Sommers is basically grandstanding by trying to take one or two historical inaccuracies and using them to discredit what is essentially a  legal  argument - and one which is on much less shaky ground that Sommers\\' out-of-context quotation of a single error suggests. \\n If anyone\\'s interested, I\\'d suggest  looking up the exchange  \"Essentially everything in Professor Lemon\\'s response is wrong.\"  Read them both and you\\'ll see pretty quickly that whatever mistakes might have made their way into their work, one of these people is following the conventions of academic scholarship, and making a well-intentioned, reasonable attempt to back up their main argument, while the other one is... not.  I don\\'t want to get political here but I think [Claire Potter\\'s]( response was bang on: \\n >if lawmakers and jurists subsequently believed that there was such a person as Romulus, and based their judgments on documents that purported to describe ancient law and practice, one might still usefully refer to such a thing as the \"Romulan rule of thumb\" playing a role in the legal oppression of women. Take a look at Warren Burger\\'s selective gloss on the history of sex in his concurrence with the majority decision in Bowers v. Hardwick (1986) if you don\\'t believe that bad history can have a major impact on the law. Or arguments that rely on an entirely invented world history of race in United States v. Thind (1923). \\n tl/dr:  Lemon is obviously wrong about Romulus, and she may over-state the level of legal/historical consensus about the \"rule of thumb\" - but Sommers is totally off-base in her attempt to use this to try to discredit Lemon\\'s scholarship, and (lets face it) feminist scholarship as a whole, and she fails to actually grasp or engage with the larger point which Lemon was trying to make, which is that the custom/doctrine that men have a right to punish their wives has a long history.  Bearing in mind that Lemon is a legal theorist rather than a historian, this isn\\'t exactly a \"gotcha,\" and errors like this are  extremely common  in legal literature - mainly because legal theorists are interested in the law, not history.  Sommers\\' conduct and tone in the whole debate are completely beyond the pale, and (folks should be aware) that she\\'s not regarded as a serious or credible scholar by most academics. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"Firstly you should keep in mind that the government and party were nominally separate entities, with authority over different things. The party, and the highest levels, basically handled the executive functions of government in terms of forming general policy (the lower levels had a whole array of other jobs) while the 'state' implemented that policy. In practice it was a bit more complex than that and Stalin's methods of rule could make that more complicated still. \\n Party \\nThe roots of the party were cells - basically any organisation that has three communists or more were to form a party cell. Those cells then send people up through their local/regional party committees, which in turn periodically have to send representatives off to the 'base' of the party centre - the Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This body didn't not meet very often (IIRC under Stalin it met quite rarely at times) so it in turn nominated candidates for a Central Committee that would meet more regularly, and handle general business. The Central Committee as well as being a body that convened and voted of things, had a number of attached departments, notably the Secretariat and Orgburo which did a lot of the 'practical' work in running the party but also other functions, like the newspaper Pravda. Since the Central Committee itself couldn't/didn't meet all the time the Politburo was formed, to decide matters when the CC was meeting and in practice it tended to act as the party's executive. So in theory the make up of these committees, bureaus etc. as well as their function was based on votes. But in practice these votes were not always free for alls, much was decided through various informal mechanisms before anything went to a vote in the first place (like picking candidates for jobs, then only having them as an option in the vote). The clearest example of theory vs. practice was the office of General Secretary - in theory they were just the chief of the administative arm of the party... under Stalin it was established as the very top of the Communist Party. \\n This diagram is perhaps a little messy, but covers all the main bits: \\n Government/State \\nLike the Communist Party, the basic units of the Soviet state were offices and committees at the local level. The parliament equivelent was the Supreme Soviet with two 'houses' - The Soviet of the Union, elected by the general population, and the Soviet of Nationalities, which had representation based on the various Union and Autonomous Republics, the smaller oblasts and okrugs etc. When the Supreme Soviet wasn't meeting, matters were handled by the Presidium, the chairman of which was nominally head of state. The Supreme Soviet also voted in the Council of Peoples Commissars (later Council of Ministers), which was the nominal executive of the state and also the guys who effectively ran the economy (so the Commissar for Heavy Industry sits here). The economic commissarates/ministries, Gosplan etc. are also part of the state, rather than the party. \\n I cannot for the life of me find an organisational chart of Soviet government that doesn't provide an overly detailed account of one arm of the state while neglecting some other function. \\n Party and State \\nThe state bodies could debate and vote on things and according to the rules could knock back laws etc., but in practice the parliament was a rubber stamp for the party. The administrative/executive organs of state were just there to implement what they were directed to do by the party. \\n Part of the overlap results from the concentration of party members in the government. It would be basically impossible to reach a high position in the government without being a party member. Key party members, like people on the Politburo, often also had formal or informal oversight of government departments. Stalin was both General Secretary (defacto party boss) and Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars (boss of the executive/economy). There was also just the general culture/doctrine that opposing the party wasn't accepted - even in the party any kind of oppositional activity, particularly in the Stalin era, was likely to cause a lot of trouble for those involved (by the time of the Purges it could prove quite fatal). So if you were in government you knew you couldn't actually derail what the party had directed, and besides you were probably a party member yourself. \\n Post-Stalin the role of the executive and parliamentary elements of the state gets a bit more nuanced (in some ways for example the Supreme Soviet was a better place for debate than the Central Committee), but not by any great margin. \\n So tl;dr - the party ran the show. The General Secretary was the boss, he ran things through the Politburo, Secretariat etc. and to a great degree the higher positions in the party could play the system to exert a degree of control over the lower level non-centre units. The main notable function of the state in this era was to run the economy in line with party direction, with a parliament to rubber stamp things for the sake of legitimacy. \\n Hope that made sense, even I get mixed up with this stuff sometimes. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"Basically, the Prussians had professionalism and really good marketing on their side, and that led to a belief - not entirely justified - that they were superior soldiers. \\n In the 18th century, it's important to remember that most professional armies, be they French, Swedish, British or Spanish, were technologically equivalent to one another. Smoothbore muskets and bayonets were the standard arm for infantry, carbines and sabers - some lances and spears - were standard for cavalry, and artillery had a maximum field range in most cases of no more than a mile. Psychologically, this cannot be underestimated. It meant that, in the standard cliche of an open-field battle, one would be able to see their enemy advancing for much longer than you could possibly do anything about it. \\n This essentially boils down into a couple of important points. One; flashy uniforms that stand out are better. It's axiomatic among people who don't actually study the era that brightly colored uniforms are stupid because they stand out,  but that's precisely the point . Tall hats like grenadiers mitres, uniforms that emphasize shoulder width, brightly polished steel on the musket and shined crossbelts all give the effect of uniformity and discipline. And two; discipline, discipline, discipline. You want the enemy to see you coming, you want your soldiers to advance regularly, and in-step if possible, because there was nothing considered more demoralizing than a perfect, seamless, disciplined advance. The more regular and drilled the advance looks, the more possibly demoralizing it was. The better you march, the better you're trained. The better you're trained, the faster you can fire your musket. And if your side can fire faster than the other side, it's much more likely that the slower side will break and run sooner, which was the ideal. Bayonet charges could decide things extremely quickly as well, since most soldiers would break and run before it ever came to fighting with them. Most nations used a big, triangular wedge between 12 and 16 inches long, a wound with one of those was terrible, and everyone knew it. You'd hotfoot it out of there if you could. \\n So, the side that appears more professional has an edge, even before firing starts. And this is primarily what the Prussians took advantage of. They were considered more professional. They made themselves the world standard, because of some complicated politics covered in some of the links posted by /u/Searocksandtrees, which manifested in a standing, professional army. \\n This army not only had a distinct advantage over, say, the British, who tended to de-militarize after major conflicts and kept a very small army in peacetime, on the simple basis that they were  professionals , but also because they had a proud tradition. Frederick William, the reformer who made the major social changes in Prussian society during and just after the 30 Year's War, laid the groundwork for Frederick the Great, who gave Prussian soldiers a winning history and did much of the work to give them their fearsome reputation. \\n The Prussians made it a point to demonstrate the efficacy of their army regularly. They invited heads of foreign armies to come to their maneuvers, which they held somewhat regularly, to see their crack units drill and fight mock battles. Some British advisors, seeing these maneuvers after the American War for Independence, claimed that Prussian soldiers could fire 6 shots in a minute (absurdly fast, but probably not terribly accurate or powerful, as they apparently skipped ramming), and marveled at how Prussian formations moved like clockwork. These maneuvers, of course, were intended to have exactly that effect. They were held on ground that was prepared, that was drilled on again and again, and the maneuvers they showed off for other nations were more like parades, but the intent was to be as flashy and as impressive as possible. \\n Combat was an entirely different story, but what they were exceptional at was showing other nations that they were the experts, whether it was justified or not. It usually worked; the British were certainly impressed, and Americans hired a Prussian to drill American regulars in the War for Independence, et al. \\n tl;dr - the Prussians were masters of self-promotion, and understood the psychological effects of a well-drilled army core. \\n Richard Holmes'  Redcoat  covers the British army more so than the Prussian, but has a lot of the contextual information with regard to soldier psychology and battlefield conditions I used above. \\n Mark Urban's  Fusiliers  as well, which covers strictly the 23rd Rgt. of Foot through the American War of Independence, but has a chapter at the end covering the period between the end of the American War and the beginning of the wars with the French, and covers the British perspective of those Prussian maneuvers. \\n And Robert Citino's  The German Way of War  is a pretty thorough and well written account of the Prussian/German military tradition and history. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('Yeah; this is actually a  great  question, and one with a surprisingly tricky answer. It flows from something that seems really simple when stated out loud but in practice gives historians a lot of trouble;  history flows into and then out of time-frames . Depending on what you\\'re interested in, the periodisation you\\'ll need to create will differ. \\n But Crossy, I hear all the browsing readers cry, with the Second World War it\\'s so simple! Before, there was a time that people with guns didn\\'t fire them at people. Surely the Second World War is when angry people stormed across borders with tanks and murder? I humbly beg your pardon, readers, but that is only one method of periodisation - one method of breaking time down. And like I said before; periodisation depends on what you\\'re  interested in , not on some magic border in time. Alas! \\n So for some people; yes, the war began in 1939 with the German invasion of Poland. For those people, it was the conflagration in Europe - and purely military themes - which formed the primary axis around which the Second World War revolved. Perfectly reasonable! Often taught at American high schools and in American universities  because  it is so reasonable. It shows interest in the military and cultural impacts of the war on European and European-language-speaking countries.  That is not a criticism . Things need to be broken down into chunks to be manageable when teaching. \\n But for some people - yes. The war began in 1937, with Japan\\'s invasion of China. Again; perfectly reasonable. Some historians study South East Asia, after all - they aren\\'t that interested in Europe. It makes sense to begin there, as the Japanese actions there create the conditions for everything else in the region, including those considered \"part of World War Two\" by those looking at Europe. This, as OP rightly points out, is taught often in South East Asia. It also implies two other things. The first is that the political and military activities of the Asia-Pacific region is as important a focus as the European - which is why historians outside South-East Asia are more commonly now using it. The second is that the war has certain  themes  that are unspooling through its undoubted military and cultural mobilizations. In this case, that the war is about different types of - for want of a better meta-term - \"Ultra-Right-Wing\" politics at their natural extreme. \\n Some historians step even further back, looking at themes of Empire, Decolonization, and Communism. Those historians start at 1914, and view both World Wars as the same - continuations of each other. This is also a perfectly reasonable period; after all, the First World War created conditions quite different from those that existed before (culturally and politically). The two wars were fought for very similar reasons and for very similar impulses; did the first world war really resolve tensions relating to Nationalism, or were those things continued into the Second? Why break them apart when they make  so much more sense taken together ? \\n Or how about those historians studying communism; some of those start the twentieth century in 1917, and end it in 1991. It actually seems reasonable to argue that communism was that century\\'s defining feature - that the Second World War should be understood inside that period as a particular campaign as part of a wider political set of anxieties (after all - wars are fought by cultures for political purpose - can we talk about a war being in isolation from the context with created it?) \\n A lot of readers are going to be pointing at me and going - you missed the point. The war was from this to this time. All the historians  I\\'ve  read say that. Only military things should define the war! And fair enough! But most people will also be reading particular kinds of history, will have been  taught  particular kinds of history, and that periodisation is appropriate for both the history they are reading and the history they choose to be taught. I truly am begging you to understand the start and end dates of anything - whenever a historian says \"I am going to start here in the story\" - those starts are arbitrary. Most historians  will  start their histories of the Second World War with a chapter of context because otherwise the military stuff doesn\\'t make any sense. How can we say it starts there if even when trying to teach it we can\\'t start there? \\n So here is the broad take-away from my post. Leaving aside the question of when World War Two started, and thinking in just plain old anything terms now. Know that when you pick what time periods you\\'re going to study, or you pick a historian with a particular set of time frames, then you need to understand that those times have been chosen to reflect the concerns and bias of the historian. You need to consider what that historian is putting in and what they are leaving out when they chose those times. \\n TL:DR Periodisation can be a real bitch. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Well, I work with late [Joseon]( political history, and as always when something has to do with politics, there\\'s a lot of bias in every source. \\n Apologies if the following is unclear; feel free to ask for any clarifications, and I\\'ll try and come back to you if I can. \\n \\n Consider [ The Annals of the Joseon Dynasty ]( the main primary source for most of the period.  The Annals  were, of course, synthesized after the death of the monarch to ensure a degree of coherence. This meant that they would be heavily influenced by the faction in power who ruled while the  Annals  were being made. \\n Joseon factional conflicts were very turbulent (I speak about them a bit [here]( and [here]( and this meant that the faction in power when the  Annals  were being synthesized and organized might be replaced within a decade! \\n For example, King [Hyeonjong]( died in 1674.  For six years almost immediately after his death - from 1674 to 1680 - the court was dominated by the  Namin  or  Southerner  faction. Not surprisingly, the Namin faction was responsible for the synthesis of the  Annals  under Hyeonjong. But in 1680, the Namin were suddenly purged from power and replaced by their enemies the  Seoin  or  Westerner  faction. \\n This meant that many ruling factions were unhappy about the way the  Annals  had been made, since it would be biased towards their enemies. And so many factions, with the permission of the king, made revised versions of the  Annals. \\n \\n The  Annals of [Seonjo]( were published under [Gwanghaegun]( by the  Bukin  ( Northerner ) faction; hence, after the dethronement of Gwanghaegun, the Seoin faction that replaced the Bukin synthesized  The Corrected Annals of Seonjo*. \\n \\n As said, the  Annals of Hyeonjong  were published by the Namin; after their purge in 1680 the Seoin published  The Revised Annals of Hyeonjong . \\n \\n The  Annals of  Sukjong ; the Soron later published the  Corrected and Expanded Annals of Sukjong.* \\n \\n We also have the  Annals of [Gyeongjong]( written with Soron influence; perhaps it was inevitable that with the rise of Noron power,  Revised Annals of Gyeonjong* was eventually created. \\n \\n \\n But thankfully for future historians, even when \"revised\" or \"corrected\" versions of the  Annals  were created, the old, supposedly \"incorrect\" versions were not destroyed! That means that we have multiple looks at the story from two opposing factions, which is a good way to verify accuracy. And really, the  Annals  don\\'t distort facts as much as we might think, though the annotations or eulogies left by the synthesizers can be very, very obviously skewed. \\n But let\\'s give an example of how I find what was more likely when given two conflicting, biased sources. In the  Annals of Gyeongjong , in August 18 1722, the king confirms that he vomited the past October; thus validating the confessions of Noron-affiliated suspects convicted of treason, who claimed that there had been a poisoning attempt on the king that had been foiled because the king vomited out the poison instead of dying. The  Revised Annals  does not mention that, instead the  Revised Annals  are littered with flattering eulogies of executed Noron statesmen. \\n Here, I (and most other historians of Joseon history; in fact, every historian on the topic I have ever read) do in fact conclude that the  Annals  are accurate here rather than the  Revised Annals.  Why? For one, the latter was published 59 years after the event, when most adults who were around at the time would already have died, and given what we know of the process of organizing and synthesizing the  Annals , bias through omission is much more likely than creating an event out of thin air.

This is true. What is also true is that they did make forays, but what they found convinced them that it wasn\\'t worth diverting the necessary resources from South America to really hold it. In contrast to South America, they found less wealthy natives and far less gold and other resources. \\n For example, priests did come with an expedition to somewhere not too far from Jamestown around 1570. When they left, they took the young ruler of the Powhatan Indians (of Pocahontas/Matoaka fame) with them back to Europe, converted him to Catholicism and gave him the name Don Luis. They ultimately returned Don Luis with the idea of using him as a Catholic leader to convert his tribe. Instead, Don Luis accepted the pagan rituals that his position required. The missionaries tried to stop this - in return they were punished by being tied to trees while the women scraped their skin off with sharp oyster shells until they died. The Spanish responded with punitive attacks, but lost interest in \"saving\" the Indians or controlling their relatively meager resources. \\n The Spanish also observed the English colonies\\' pain. They watched Roanoke fail, and even sent scouts to check out what the Jamestown settlers were doing. They scouts reported a small colony is disarray, starving and without any obvious ways of making  a long-term base work (this was before John Rolfe, aka husband to Pocahontas, discovered that the tobacco seeds smuggled north from Spanish Venezuela could grow so well in Virginia soil). Based on this report, the scouts and their superiors decided to let Jamestown fail on its own as Roanoke did without moving in and risking an international incident. They certainly didn\\'t want Jamestown\\'s pain for themselves. \\n TLDR: Initially, northern colonization seemed like a hassle without sufficient reward, and a costly one at a time when there were far easier pickings down south not yet fully exploited. As the value of the northern holdings became more clear, Spain found itself unable to sieze true control in these new areas while it struggled to maintain control over areas that it already had. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Straight answer is no. Contrarily to popular belief, and I might go and copy this over to the misconception threat going on, the church is really one of the only reasons intellectualism survived during the middle ages. \\n Here a few things to get out of the way..\\nThe Islamic/Arabic civilizations only really came into full existence at the start of the 9th century, sometime after the death of Muhammad and the establishment mostly political leadership rather than religious. \\n On top of that, the Arab world was plagued constantly by civil wars and fragmentation, basically, though it became an intellectual power in the 10th-14th centuries, it was not a perfect organization. That out of the way back to the \"No.\" \\n After the fall of the Roman Empire in the west, the only real authority left other than warlords was the church. It was these people who tried their damnedest to maintain and preserve every scrap of information they could get their hands on. When things got really violent, it was the church who stepped in and tried to enforce things like the Peace and Truce of God to get nobles to stop killing each other (though this could also be seen as a power play by the church). Even the First Crusade was an attempt by the church to siphon off western aggression to a place that was not western. (again, this is debated, but this is one school of thought) \\n Medieval Universities and philosophers were almost always aligned with the church. Education was run by them and the old Roman works were preserved by them. The reason why we did not really see \"intellectual advancement\" is two fold, Culture and resources. \\n Medieval culture did not necessarily prize warfare. The only people who could afford to be educated were aristocrats, and aristocrats valued warfare. Go and look up the differences between King Phillip and King Richard during the Third Crusade. One was a warrior (Richard) the other was something of a thinker (Phillip). While Richard is regard in the primary sources as a legendary hero, warrior and fantastic king for his almost constant warfare, Phillip who chose to focus on enhancing the bureaucracy of his country and fight less is considered by the sources to be more or less as sniveling coward. The culture did not call for intellectuals, it called for its men monks to teach and preserve and for warriors. At the same time, when a noble came into excess resources  which could have been used for say, supporting an intellectual, the culture instead called for building a church or throwing a large feast and giving gifts, the warrior culture which grew out of the Germanic warlord after the end of the Roman west did not call for intellectualism as a stable point. (The Caliphate was different, it was large enough, and diverse enough to support a culture that prized intellectual advancement) \\n The next bit is resources. Mortality was high during this period, women were likely to die in childbirth and children were likely to die young. A large group of people had to farm indecent farmland to support their own family, his lord, and his household. Resources were very scare and hard to come by. BUT when they DID have highly excessive resources, intellectualism would ignite like a wide fire. See the Carolingian Renaissance. (tldr-Charlemagne, through highly successful military campaigns, flooded his empire with gold in the mid to late 8th century, as a result, he could afford to support intellectuals and we get some of the best intellectual, philosophical, artistic and theological texts during this period. This was during the supposed \"darkest\" of the dark age). During the 13th and 14th century, when governments start to really take form, and urban life starts to regrow, intellectualism once again flourishes, and the west continued to grow and surpassed the East, which grew stagnant. \\n Wow that turned out longer than I expected. \\n [Look at Thinking Medieval by Marcus Bull for more info on this, and other misconceptions on the Middle Ages.]( \\n',\n  0),\n ('A few things. \\n You talk about how Augusus didn\\'t call himself emperor, but no emperor did...well, no.  That\\'s inaccurate. \\n See, the term \"emperor\" comes from the Latin \"imperator\" which was indeed a title and a quite prestigious one at that.  But it was a title conferred onto a great  general  by his legions after a great conquest.  It did not hold any actual power.  Imperators existed long before the empire period did, and it wasn\\'t a particularly unusual development.  It just meant a great general.  And many of what we call emperors nowadays were imperators, but its best not to confuse the two concepts.  They\\'re very different ideas. \\n >why Caesar, the man who declared himself dictator for life, was not considered the first. \\n Not sure if you\\'re aware of this concept, but a dictator was, similarly, not a huge thing in Roman history.  Well, it was...but it wasn\\'t as if an American politician declared himself a dictator.  A dictator was simply an office voted in in times of great emergency.  For example, a war that\\'s threatening Rome.  They would promote someone to dictator, and he\\'d get free reign to do as he wants for 6 months, to save the republic.  What made Caesar different isn\\'t that he named himself dictator (which happened  quite a few times , but that he named himself dictator  for life .  He didn\\'t plan on stepping down when he was done.  This was an illegal act and has never, ever been--oh wait, it has.  By Sulla. \\n Sulla, who came a few decades before Caesar, and who started a one of many civil wars in the period, had himself declared himself dictator for life.  Which was a huge deal of course, but Julius wasn\\'t first. \\n If I\\'m not mistaken, the office of  princeps  (for the beginning of the empire) did not grant  all  powers over the republic.  A dictator had more power than a princeps.  I should note that there are a few words used to refer to emperors...chief amongst them \"Caesar\", but it appears that the term \"princeps\" referred to all of them until Diocletian in the late 200s.) \\n Overall, I\\'d say the reason why Julius Caesar isn\\'t considered the first emperor is because he wasn\\'t a princeps.  He was a dictator, and he transgressed boundaries by declaring himself  dictator for life , but he wasn\\'t actually the first guy to be given the original title we now, in the future, refer to as an emperor.  That was Augustus.   Augustus developed the legal basis for emperors to exist   He gained the powers through shrewd manipulation of the senate and people, and he was able to pass this position on to his sons.  Caesar, on the other hand, managed to take over the city with an army, and declare himself dictator for life.  This is not unique, and there isn\\'t an indication that he was striving to create a new position, nor even a hereditary one.  As far as I know, that was all Augustus.  Caesar was simply doing what Sulla had done a few decades before. \\n tl;dr: Caesar isn\\'t considered an emperor because he wasn\\'t the one who first legally held the office of what we now call emperor. \\n Apologize if this is badly written/confusing. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Where did this come from and how did it get around? \\n The answer is farms,  chinampas , and markets, markets, markets. \\n Land \\n The simplest answer is that the Aztec system was a kind of feudal system. Nobles ( pipiltin ) would be granted lands in conquered territories and direct relatives of the rulers of any of the three cities (Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, Tlacopan) that made up the Aztec Triple Alliance were prime candidates for marrying into the ruling families of other cities, thereby securing their fealty. \\n Essentially, every large Mesoamerican city was supported by a large swathe of agricultural land that supplied the city. \\n Water \\n Of course, not every city had large amounts of land around it. Tenochtitlan (max pop est between 150-250+ thousand) was an island. The solution was  chinampas . These were essentially hydroponic farm/drain land farms of the sort that would make the Dutch blush. Artificial islands would be made from lumping mud and vegetation onto a pre-arranged grid of stakes. These islands would be of fairly uniform size and separated by canals. \\n These raised beds were constantly irrigated by the high water table beneath them and could be fertilized by the constant addition of compost and night soil. Collecting human feces was actually a fairly esteemed (and organized) job among the Aztecs. The Aztec ruler who took over after the Spanish captured then killed Motecuhzoma was named Cuitlahuac, meaning (roughly) \"possessor of excrement.\" Poop was serious business in Tenochtitlan. \\n Basically, the piling of highly fertile soil (and other things) upon a constantly irrigated mudflat supplemented by hydroponic germination on seed-bed islands, made chinampas hugely productive. They were easily the equal of more \"traditional\" (in the Eurasic sense) farmland. \\n Markets \\n The Aztecs were a hugely mercantile society augmented by the fact that their \"Empire\" was basically a giant tribute/extortion scheme. Moving past that though, markets had long been an integral part of Mesoamerican life. There was a whole class of people who were long-distance traders ( pochteca ), but there was also an intrinsic system of markets ( tianquiztli ) that convened every five days in every major polity (though low level marketing would never really stop). Certain markets would have their specialties (Acolman was good for dogs, Aztcapotzalco for slaves, etc.), the markets also served as a way to distribute goods beyond the kind of feudal tribute system that supplied the elites. \\n These were not small affair either. Imagine a combination shopping mall, supermarket, outlet store, temp agency, and whatever else you can imagine, all occurring in the same place. By the late Aztec period, for instance, the market in Tenochtitlan\\'s annexed sister-city, Tlatelolco, drew crowds more than 20K every day, with perhaps double that on those 5th-day markets. Tlatelolco is an extreme, being the largest market in Mesoamerica at the time, but is indicative of the kind of organized distribution network (again, aside from the tribute network) that supplied Mesoamerican cities. \\n TL:DR:  Make some tacos, don\\'t use onions, cilantro, limes, beef, pork, chicken, dairy, garlic, pepper, or cumin.

I defer to an appropriate expert in this area. I will also try and be brief, but I invite comments/questions for further explanation. \\n Alexander the Great, being the son and heir of King Philip II (who conquered Greece during this period), was presumably given the absolute best in terms of education and training. His tutor, famously, was Aristotle, but evidence suggests that he was given the traditional high-class Greek education which, translated roughly, followed the guideline of \"sound mind, sound body.\" So, he was likely taught traditional \"Academy subjects\" such as speech, mathematics, \"natural philosophy\" (i.e. the sciences, etc.) but also was trained in sports, warfare, and other non-intellectual pursuits. \\n Now, around this time Aristotle and his associates were often accused of being sophists (which is a subject for another post), and Isocrates, a philosophical rival of the Academy and a friend of King Philip, wrote a letter about how this could \"corrupt\" Alexander. He said: \\n (excerpt) [Apologies, Reddit won\\'t let me post the original greek but I will translate] (original text  here \\n > Unfortunately, I am told that you study the wrong type of philosophy.

For you who are destined to be a monarch and ruler of peoples eristic is entirely unsuitable. Don\\'t forget your future rank, don\\'t forget that you should think of yourself as superior to your subjects. Are you to engage in eristic disputations with your inferiors? Yours is to command, not to persuade; theirs is to obey, not to debate with you.

The wider world became convinced that the relatively free thought being practiced in Ancient Greece was a potentially corrupting influence. There is even a theory among biblical scholars that Sodom and Gomorrah were viewed as \"immoral\" due to the influence of Greek thought. Islamic texts from later periods confirm this perception. \\n So, while the quote has potentially two historically viable meanings (either that Greek education made a man \"whole\" or that there was a certain amoral effect of it), it is unlikely that Alexander would criticize Greek education. He was a product of it, and was likely happy with the result. As to whether he specifically said it, it\\'s tough to say. Specific stories regarding Alexander are frustratingly almost always tainted by at least a hint of mythos and legend. \\n tl;dr It\\'s tough to say, but he likely had a rather high opinion of Greek education. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"I cannot comment directly on the military power of the Chinese in the 1960's but I can offer a good reason as to why American political leaders wished to avoid the intervention of Chinese forces in Vietnam. This answer lies in the Chinese intervention in Korea just 10 years earlier. After US forces landed in Inchon they were able to quite effectively move the front-lines of the war back across the 38th Parallel. This completed the policy of containment in Korea, however, both American and UN forces began to implement a policy of [rollback]( with the goal of defeating communist North Korea and uniting the peninsula. This [map]( shows just how far UN forces got to taking the entire peninsula. However, the line which UN forces held in the middle of October of 1950 was too close to the Chinese border for the comfort of Mao Zedong who warned the approaching UN forces that if they reached the Yalu river that Chinese forces would intervene. President Truman and General MacArthur were undeterred by this potential intervention basing their decisions on the CIA and other intelligence deparments' reports that the Chinese didn't have an effective Air Force. Regardless of their lack of Air Power the Chinese sent the UN forces on a full-scale route back to the 38th Parallel where the border remains today. Here is an [article]( by Dr. Clayton James of the Virginia Military Institute who covers the Chinese Intervention in the Korean War and MacArthur's role in mistaking the power of the Chinese military.

Theoretically they still use it as their authority to award degrees, but we're so far removed from the original foundation that it's only real significance is to allow students and graduates to feel smug about the pedigree of the university (because damn it, Edinburgh may consistently beat us in the World Rankings, but we're still nearly 150 years older than them!). So really, it's not really that great a loss that it's, well, lost, but the story behind it is at least mildly interesting. \\n The University was established in 1451 by the combined efforts of James II and Bishop William Turnbull, and made official by a Bull from Pope Nicholas V. Now, to be honest, the university wasn't particularly necessary or successful; there was already one in St Andrews, and a country the size of Scotland did not need two fully formed universities, and this is made most evident by the fact that a century later (after yet  another  university had been founded in Aberdeen). Glasgow was barely even functioning, with matriculations barely scraping double figures. \\n However, when the Reformation came, and the Archbishop and Chancellor James Beaton fled to France, he took with him the ceremonial Mace and as much of the University archives as he could, including the Papal Bull. Despite repeated requests from the University  and the Kirk, and the return of the Mace, Beaton refused to relinquish the archives. Towards the end of the 17th century, the Bull was seen in the Archives of the Scots College (a Catholic seminary) in Paris, along with a mass of Royal Charters pertaining to the University, which would be phenomenally interesting and useful for people studying the early history. About 50 years later, the University made another request for the archives to be returned, only to be told by the College that they were nowhere to be found in their own Archives. \\n Now, the truth of this is open to debate. I'm inclined to believe that the Scots College were just trying to thumb their noses at the Protestant University, especially since the Archivist at the time was a renowned antiquarian and thus would be unlikely to want to relinquish them. However, regardless of the truth of it in the 1740s, come the French Revolution, the College was ransacked by the revolutionaries. Some of the archives were smuggled out, but the location is unknown.  I'd say it's probably likely they took them to the College in Douai, further to the North, but this college itself was closed by Napoleon at which point the trail dies. We don't even know if Glasgow's Bull was among them. I imagine the Paris scholars would have been more concerned with two centuries of their own archives rather than those of another institution. \\n So  TL;dr , the founding document of the second oldest Scottish, and fourth oldest Anglophone University was likely destroyed during the political upheaval in 18th Century France, which is  clearly  yet another reason for everyone to hate Robespierre and the Jacobins. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('I don\\'t think anyone denies that killing millions of people is worthy of being condemned- however, when judging a historical figure, we should consider  everything  they did.  Other than a few Russians with rose-colored glasses, most historians and laymen condemn Stalin as a tyrant responsible for the deaths of tens of millions of Soviet citizens.  But we look at what was created as well as what was destroyed- both death and momentous changes in history were the result of their actions. \\n The Napoleonic Wars resulted in about ~3.5 million dead, most of which were military.  The result was the Pax Britannica, the creation of the Napoleonic Code, and the complete reform of law and the civil service in continental Europe.  Napoleon revolutionized warfare, law, and government.  He is lionized for those accomplishments, and the deaths are discounted because they were mostly military, and there was relatively little civilian suffering. \\n Qin Shi Huang in China is revered.  It is well known he was a tyrant who cared little and less about human life (something China has always had in plenty).  Most people don\\'t discount the deaths; they simply think his legacy of unifying China is far more important.  People will be born and replace the lost; the institutions built have lasted two thousand years, and are the foundation of Chinese national identity and political unity. \\n And I very much disagree- there is a meaningful difference between millions of dead and genocide.  Genocide is not a numbers game; Rwanda, Armenia, and Bosnia all had lower body counts than many WWI battles.  Genocide is condemned as a horrific crime because it\\'s organized, determined extermination of civilian populations for the sole purpose of eliminating an entire group of people because of who they are.  Hitler did an amazing job at revitalizing Germany and her industries; the ability of Germany to come back and fight and win a second war so quickly is nothing short of astonishing.  But those accomplishments are far outshone by the murder of civilians.  Not accidental famine, starvation, or other forms of collateral damage, but systemic and intentional murder. \\n Of course, Genghis and Qin Shi Huang also killed millions with organized violence.  But intentions matter- Genghis never wanted to wipe any groups off the map.  It was a calculated diplomatic and military policy.  Kill a Mongol messenger or ambassador?  A city resists?  Destroy it, completely.  It is cruel, and most people condemn such actions.  But it is not \"This is an Arab city.  All Arabs must die, so I\\'m going to burn it\".    It was a psychological tactic- if you surrender, saving us time and lives, you live if you pay your taxes.  Most cities would realize that they would be taken eventually, and they could save themselves by not resisting.  To his men, he was saving them from having to participate in grueling sieges that could result in much hardship.  As a military leader in charge of a nomadic army ill-suited for winter sieges, having cities surrender quickly during the summer and fall is ideal.  Through that prism, while beyond cold, it is an extremely efficient strategy.  The Nazi or Armenian genocides?  The famine in Ukraine?  They served no purpose, and were completely avoidable.  They were nothing short of organized murder.  Pol Pot is condemned by history for the same reason.  Caesar, Charlemagne, Alexander, and others were not guilty of murder for the sole purpose of murder.  The millions of bodies were a byproduct of wars of conquest, consolidation, expansion, and the accompanying chaos and famine.  Nobody likes those deaths; but in general, historians recognize that war happens.  A few make the mistake of glorifying war; but like it or not, wars are brutal and were frequent.  And lots of people died.  From that perspective, the number of \"good guys\" are basically.... zero.  Very few leaders had the luxury of peace.  Mao is more of a mixed bag- the Great Leap Forward was horrific, but it was originally done in good faith- the disaster that followed was compounded by natural disasters and mass denial.  Mao and other officials had no idea until much later; when they did know, they felt continuing the cover-up was the best course.  The Cultural Revolution is much more easily identifiable as an avoidable disaster borne from hubris, but was an internal power struggle- the deaths and chaos are seen as a form of civil war (or civil strife), another \"common\" occurrence, and not really a \"crime\".  Just really bad management and leadership. \\n Back to Qin Shi Huang.  He  is  seen as a hero.  One who killed millions of people.  But it isn\\'t because of his tomb or terracotta army- it is because of the profound reforms and his success in truly unifying China and forging a national identity.  He also ended centuries of war- the movie Hero actually summarizes the official line about him quite well.  Yes, he crushed countries and millions died.  But the result was an end to the warfare that had caused everyone to suffer, and the creation of a more than an empire, but a nation with a unified writing system and converging cultural and governing traditions. \\n TL;DR Lots of bodies does not a genocide make, nor do you need a really big pile of bodies to make it genocide.  Most people who actually commit genocide- Pol Pot, Hitler, Stalin- are condemned by history.  The so-called Great Men are so called because they did Great Things, not because they didn\\'t do anything that contradicts modern morality.  In some cases, those accomplishments are diminished by the price they paid in blood. \\n Last bit.

Oklahoma may have sought the correction, but by that time land sales were based on the Cimarron meridian, so it would have created a new wave of headaches--and it's entirely likely that acceptance of the surveyed boundary was, as with so many states, a condition of admission.

It addresses the mytho-historical conquest of a region called \"Amerika\" by curiously pale people from across a large ocean. The peoples of Amerika were doomed to fall because of their inferior technology. This was not because they were incompetent oafs who were not active agents during their own conquest (since that\\'s racist), but because of their geography. The land where these so-called \"Inca\" and \"Maya\" lived determined their eventual fates. \\n This is the same case with the witches of Oz. There have been several attempts to dramatize the divergence of the witches\\' alignments, most notably Gregory Maguire semi-autobiographical work  Wicked.  But this, and its stage adaptation, are pure pop history and rather revisionist, written for the entertainment of the masses. Solid geographical theory says otherwise. \\n Let\\'s first go back to correct some history. The preeminent Oz scholar L.Frank Baum records a time when Wicked Witches ruled all four quadrants of Oz, subduing the Munchkins in the west, the Quadlings to the south,  the Winkies to the east, and the Gillikins to the north. Glinda the Good Witch, Oz\\'s most powerful sorcerer actually overthrew the old tyrant in the South and installed the Good Witch of the North herself. Regardless, good evidence exists that these Good Witches were native to their own lands, and the Wicked Witches all originated in the east of west. \\n So back to theory. In Diamond\\'s book, he proposes that this land across the sea, which some call \"Asia\" or maybe \"Europe\" (though some cryptic tomes from its early history say \"Middle Earth\"), was particularly wide. Much of it existed in similar biomes, and this accelerated trade, exchange of ideas, and technological development. The same can be said to have occured in Oz. Across the east-west axis, trade and exchange thrived at some time prior to Oz\\'s unification. This wealth got to the heads of the residents, and they became increasingly cunning and manipulative. Natural selection played its course, except here it was \"survival of the wickedest.\" (This also led to the development of the traditional  pointed cap  Wicked witches from the east and west soon conquered the less developed regions of the north and south, before installing the Wizard of Oz as a single ruler to justify their colonialism. Local revolutions installed the Good Witches of the North and South.

The east west were better suited for trade and development and accumulate wealth, and with it greed. Wicked Witches were selected for and conquered their neighbors.

The academic robes we still wear are a significant reminder of this, and there are many things we don't question that stem from medieval tradition. Back then, books were expensive and rare, and not many people were literate. Libraries in medieval monasteries were many things: storage, areas of privilege, and creative centers. Scribes wrote and copied books all day long, glossed in margins, and collected and shared rare books. Consider that literally every hour of these people's lives was planned out with some sort of duty--a lot of singing, a lot of work, and very little sleep.

It's all (or mostly) about commitment mechanisms.  But the huge difference between a monastery and a commune (whether secular or religious) is the power of the authority structure justifying the existence of the community.  In the case of monasteries, it's the Catholic or Orthodox Church and the local kings and noblemen (who often founded and funded the monasteries, sent people to them, and punished runaways).  In the case of intentional communities in general - especially American ones - it's just 'let's go do this and see what happens', or 'let's all follow this dude's cult of personality until we get tired of him'. \\n (I'd also note that  communes  are a modern phenomenon, and the modern world has all sorts of opportunities, whereas  monasteries  come from a time and place where people had far fewer good options.  What was the old medieval nobles' slogan?  The first son to inherit, the second for the army, the third for the priesthood?  Much of the difference in longevity may well be the society outside the monastery - and I will note that monasteries/nunneries are declining and shutting their doors all over the world, despite the Church's best efforts to recruit.) \\n A good resource for the general question of the survival of communes is Kanter, R.

The tl;dr is that  religious  communes are not actually any more long-lived than secular ones; rather, the only statistically significant variables on the longevity of intentional communities are total population (higher is better), year established (the longer it's been around, the more likely it is to survive longer), and whether or not it owns its land.  That monasteries are more integrated into the structure of society in general is probably a larger factor in their survival than their religious nature. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"Monasteries typically have a hierarchical power structure. Plus the adherents, when joining, agree to follow the rules, including those laid down by the abbot and the church. If someone steps out of line they are banished. There is also those whole concept of humility. People have invested their life in their religious beliefs and they can't leave easily. Additionally, the other brothers all have similar beliefs, so this helps hold them all together. Monasteries also have ways to make money through donations or getting seed money from their church. If there is a dispute, the abbot, the church, or their holy book will have the answer. \\n People who join communes often want to get away from power structures and rules. So the communes either don't have rules, make up new/non-traditional rules for which there may not be a precedent, or try some sort of democracy-lite. This only lasts until someone tries to take advantage of the situation to their personal benefit. It also creates a gray area during disputes. Who has authority? And how far does it extend? If someone assumes power/enforces rules then the whole concept of their commune is turned on its head. The people in the commune may not share similar beliefs about how life should be lived, and making money to support the commune is a big problem. \\n Lastly, in a commune, often there is not as much invested. If it doesn't work out, you can always return to mainstream life. This makes it easy for people to come and go, but really doesn't do much for creating strong bonds and a healthy social fabric. In a monastery, leaving and re-integrating into mainstream life is much harder. So people tend to accept the power structure, try harder to work things out, and preserve the traditions that may have been passed down for centuries. \\n TL;DR - in a monastery or any sort of religious commune, there are stronger bonds holding people together, whereas in a secular commune, there are more forces pulling people apart. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('I\\'m about halfway through * Pacific Worlds . Highly, highly recommended. \\n I was struck by the way Matsuda presents the interaction between Europeans and Pacific Islanders in the 17th and early 18th centuries - in particular, before the murder of Capt. Cook in Hawaii. He certainly doesn\\'t gloss over the cruelties that occurred during this period, but the way he lays it out seems to be much more peaceful, cooperative, and mutually respectful prior to Cook\\'s death. \\n It seems that prior to that event, the prevailing interpretation of many native cultures such as those in the Pacific Islands was the \"noble savage\" - man was inherently good, curious, loyal, and friendly, and was corrupted by the influences of modern (I should say contemporary, I suppose) \"civilization.\" Islanders of noble standing would often join with European crews and sail to Sydney, Melbourne, London, and the Continental European capitals, where they would learn European languages, study European history, philosophy, theology, and science, and in turn would expose aristocratic Europeans to their own culture. Certainly, there was a great deal of the \"tattooed man\" going on, where the Islander was more of a curiousity than a peer, but there seems to have been a respect on the part of European gentry for the visitors, even if it was the result of colonial and imperialistic views of \"educating\" the foreigner. \\n After Cook\\'s death, however, the relationship soured considerably, and missionary, military, slaving, and exploitative activities were scaled up hugely. Violent interactions between Whites and Islanders became the rule rather than the exception. Islanders were decimated on scales comparable to Native Americans. Matsuda seems to argue that this was, at least in part, a direct result of Cook\\'s murder shifting European views of the Islanders from the peaceful noble savage to, well, simply savages, to be converted and exploited for the benefit of European governments and companies. \\n I must admit that this narrative is highly appealing to my own sensibilities - I  love  the idea, in an extremely naive and genteel way, that there was at least the possibility that the two cultures could learn from and converse with each other with some sort of mutual respect - even if I find the sort of respect the Europeans had for the Islanders to be despicable, from a modern perspective. However, my skeptical side finds the narrative a little too convenient. As I said, he doesn\\'t gloss over \"unfriendly\" interactions prior to Cook\\'s death, but the emphasis is undeniably on constructive and \"friendly\" interaction beforehand, and destructive afterwards. \\n tl;dr: Were European-Pacific interactions really \"friendly\" prior to Captain Cook\\'s murder in Hawaii, and \"unfriendly\" (i.e. violent and exploitative) after, speaking very generally?

It was quickly suppressed by riot police in Seoul and faded in the rest of the country.  Gwangju refused to submit and resisted, eventually a group composed of students and citizens seized control of the city.  The demonstrators demanded democratic reform, confident in the belief that the United States would be forced to move to support them, or risk losing face as the \"leader of the free world\". \\n They were wrong.  South Korean troops released from Unified Command with the knowledge of the United States were dispatched to the city of Gwangju to violently suppress the protesters.  They immediately took the city, with many casualties (There is some dispute - the official record is around 150 civilians but others have argued that the evidence suggests more than 1,000 dead.)  Our information on the incident comes from a series of State Department documents known as the [Cherokee Files]( accessed through the Freedom of Information Act.  They contain transcripts from meetings regarding Gwangju, as well as reports on the political situation from U.S Ambassador to South Korea, William H. Gleysteen.

Indeed, Assistant Secretary Holbrooke is quoted in one document saying, \"No one wants another Iran.\" \\n Other quotes from the documents show a sentiment hoping that General Chun would suppress Gwangju as peacefully he had Seoul, but the fact remains that the U.S sanctioned, with full knowledge, the military suppression of a pro-democracy movement. \\n In Korea, the date is something of a bitter pill.  Some Koreans today believe that 518 [as it is colloquially known]( was an essential step on the path to free, democratic elections.

Also since \"the dark ages\" is a notoriously vague term, I\\'m going to discuss primarily the 12th century. \\n On the first issue, when we ask what Medieval scholars  knew  about Rome, we need to first establish what that question would entail for them. Certainly Medieval authors knew a variety of Roman historians, such as Suetonius and Sallust, as well as a variety of authors writing this related to history, such as Vergil and Lucian. But this really isn\\'t the question at hand, as the question shouldn\\'t be, did they know these authors, but rather, how did they use these authors to create a sense of history. Now there are a variety of arguments over whether there was a bona fide sense of history in the early middle ages, the problem being twofold. First of all, they continued to maintain the classical understanding of what \"history\" was, indeed to quote Isidore: \\n >History is so called from the Greek term ίστορεῖν (“inquire, observe”), that is, from ‘seeing’ or from ‘knowing.’ Indeed, among the ancients no one would write a history unless he had been present and had seen what was to be written down, for we grasp with our eyes things that occur better than what we gather with our hearing, since what is seen is revealed without falsehood. \\n But most historians of the Early Middle Ages, at least, were Monks who were simply collating other texts and stories they had heard. Secondly, again for the Early Middle Ages, we know that a lot of what they wrote simply isn\\'t correct, indeed Smalley pointed out that the more a medieval historian quoted Suetonius (I believe) the less accurate their statement was likely to be. \\n Now there is an important break in the twelfth century with a revival of historical thought. Now there is a theoretical underpinning to this in the increased historical discussion in the development of history as the literal sense of a text, particularly the bible. This new historical thought is particularly prevalent, and potentially developed, in the writing of Hugh of St Victor, as well as later Victorine writers, who stress the importance of knowing history and of history as the fundamentally important level of understanding for the text to be meaningful. \\n But we should not understand, as some have, this change as equivalent to the idea of textual criticism in the Renaissance, wherein they were interested in finding the \"real\" texts of Antiquity. Rather the historical sensibility of the twelfth century, and middle ages more generally, was presented under the theme of  translatio . This means that the centrally important organizing concept in medieval political history was the idea of the translation of empires (or  translatio imperii ). This concept emerges out of the Christian histories of late antiquity, like those of Eusebius-Jerome and Orosius, where they used the beasts and statue in the book of Daniel as an organizing principle of world empires. Namely they argued that there was a succession of world empires concluding with the Romans. As a result, the Roman empire sort of had to be the continued empire. Thus for both their own political propaganda and for this eschatological imperative, Western Empires presented themselves as continuers of the Roman empire. It also meant that the drive of historical knowledge was not knowing things about the past, but saying things about the present, it was about drawing direct continuities between the ancient Medes and the twelfth century Germans (or whoever). \\n Now this gets more complicated as by the twelfth century, in the heart of the investiture controversy, the donation of Constantine (or more accurately the myth thereof) became an important principle. Essentially the story was that Constantine I, after converting to Christianity, gave political rulership over the Western Roman Empire to Pope Sylvester. \\n So with all that in place, the Western Christians understood the Romans as the last world empire, they knew the chronology of the Romans, particularly of the imperial period, as they had gathered from the various Classical historians, as I mentioned earlier. But they were particularly interested in figuring out  what  happened in the Roman period, as that would be, to an extent, beside the point. Likewise, for them the Roman empire never fell. To go with Otto of Freisings version, the Roman empire passed from the romans to the Greeks, with the Byzantine empire, until the time of Charlemagne. Then, since Charlemagne was crowned by the Pope, the legal arbiter of the Western Roman Crown after the \\'Donation of Constantine\\', Charlemagne became the Roman emperor, with the empire passing from the Greeks to the Franks. Finally, with the decline of the Frankish empire, and the Crowning of the German emperors like Otto I, the Roman empire passed from the Franks to the Germans. Hence, to the medieval mind, the Roman empire didn\\'t end at all and indeed the western Roman Empire was still thriving. This is particularly evident with Frederick Barbarossa calling his empire the Holy Roman Empire, no matter what Voltaire happens to think about it. \\n Now since this idea of history is fundamentally forward looking, so the Roman past wasn\\'t generally viewed as something different, and the present wasn\\'t viewed in relation to the past, as we would understand it. Rather the past was largely viewed in relation to the present. So, for example, with the illustration of emperors in the Manuscripts of Otto\\'s work we see Augustus, Charlemagne and Otto I all represented as looking [exactly the same]( \\n TL;DR: they knew essentially the history of Rome as recorded by Roman historians but they didn\\'t understand Rome as a historical civilization in the same sense that we do. Rather Rome was still alive and well in the various successor states to the Roman empire, be it the Byzantine Empire, the Frankish Empire or the German Empire. And although it is technically true that in the Byzantine Empire the Roman Empire didn\\'t fall till 1453, that isn\\'t how it would have been viewed in Latin Christendom through the Middle ages. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"Mikhail Gorbachev was the leader of the Soviet Union (USSR), which controlled east Germany as a result of the WWII armistice.

Even before formal apartheid, there was a \"color bar\" that limited how high in the structure of businesses blacks could advance. Whites benefited from apartheid in this regard but they were not explicitly guaranteed a job. As for locking their doors, it is true that Apartheid South Africa had lower crime rates than post-Apartheid South Africa. This is a natural outgrowth of a police state. Police states are often aimed at preventing political dissent, but they also tend to reduce other types of crime as well. \\n An additional benefit to Whites under Apartheid was that the price of labor and goods was heavily depressed because of the way Blacks were treated. This meant that someone could live at a relatively higher standard of living as a white person in South Africa than they could have in the US or the UK. \\n > Or did whites suffer from an authoritarian, paternalistic regime \\n The answer to this is yes. They obviously didn\\'t endure anywhere near the suffering of black South Africans, but they were also restricted in invasive and authoritarian ways. For example, there were laws limiting Blacks to what are essentially corollaries to Indian Reservations for native Africans without certain documentation. This meant that they couldn\\'t work in the (relatively) more lucrative jobs in the cities without permission. Whites were also not allowed to hire them and could be fined heavily if they hired someone that was not allowed to work. I want to stress again that they punishment would not be as severe for Whites, but they still had little choice in the matter and the fines could be fairly substantial. Many of the laws targeting native Africans also limited the freedom of Whites in some regard (though, and I stress this, not to the same degree). \\n They were also restricted by the authoritarian government. \\n As for the economic stagnation, a little quick research shows the GDP growing fairly steadily over time. I don\\'t see anything that indicates that the government caused the economy to stagnate though it is impossible to know what would have happened in the absence of the Apartheid government. \\n tl;dr:  Yes, white South Africans benefited from Apartheid, but they were also limited by the government politically and economically, though to a far lesser degree than Blacks.

I take great pleasure  in tackling everyday negative myths about WWI and am, at times, even accused of being a war hawk; in fact quite often. However even this is too far for me; ultimately this was one of the most brutal wars in history almost regardless of where you were; even the African front was not saved from suffering with both sides (but especially the Germans) exploiting the Africans within. Just in Paul von Lettow-Vorbecks shenanigans in East Africa alone throughout the war upwards of 400,000 forced African laborers alone would die under his watch. \\n If you want to be safe your best bet is something far away from anything that could give you \"a war story or two\". Frankly this is war and there is no safe zone for people to have the time of their lives on an adventure while also being pristine and safe. You\\'re either a paper pusher or some mechanic on a plane away from the action or you are in danger; it\\'s that simple. You\\'re either on the front lines or serving in some capacity on them, on the ships dealing especially with persistent U-boat threats or in a plane about to be shot out of the sky from small arms fire. \\n If you were pressing me instead where the safest place for a \\'frontline soldier\\' (or people serving on their behalf in other ways) I\\'d instantly say the Middle East; particularly the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. Lots of maneuver and small battles; I don\\'t know off the top of my head any major battles where the Brits lost anything more than a few thousand men and most major battles consisted of a few dozen to a few hundred out of numerous available divisions. The Western Force as it was appropriately called dealt with Libyan jihadists and German support while the Eastern Force (again appropriately called) held the Suez Canal and then pushed into Palestine. \\n However with that said this would have been a total anomaly if you were British. The Light Horse brigades were Australian and the Imperial Service Cavalry was from various Indian ethnic groups. The British infantry divisions which were sent were sent from specific localities as British infantry generally was raised in the early days of the war; you couldn\\'t say \"I wanna go to the Egyptian party\" it was \"You and your buddies signed up in Lancashire; we\\'re sending a division of you blokes there (3 brigades) and a division of Scots too.\"* Generally that\\'s how it worked in these things; most forces in the Mideast and fighting in not-Europe for the Brits were colonials and those who supported them as British mainlanders were just sent there as a cog in the machine. \\n Wikipedia is generally faux-pas around here but the page on the  Egyptian Expeditionary Force  troops with certain British mainlanders cycled in and out. Essentially if you weren\\'t part of those groups raised at the time those groups were raised in those specific regions you could not have \"requested\" to be there even as an officer. However, with that said, throughout \\'15 and early \\'16 a lot of Kitcheners \"New Army\", Britain\\'s first modern volunteer army, would be cycled into this Mediterranean/Mesopotamian theater to gain battle experience before being sent into the Western Front.

You could count on either being killed by the Russians or French or British though so it\\'s a tough decision.

I can't quite rember the stats but in WWI Gas casulaties usually had a 5% mortality rate once gas masks etc were widely issued. (Compared to the rule of thumb 'average' fatality rate of casualies which is 33% in this period). Thus it wasn't very effective, and you might as well just use HE. \\n Similar sats apply to cities - gas masks were widely issued to civilians in london etc. Pound for pound incendiary bombing seemed like (and probably was) a much better way to go. \\n Gas however does make things more difficult - you have to do everything in a gas mask, often with added skin irritation etc! This was its primary purpose in the later stages of WWI. Here, though, the 'human factor' came in - the people who made the decisions about whether to use gas (or at least advised the people who made the decisions) were the ones who would have fight in these unpleasant if not lethal circumstances. Thus unless there was a decisive advantage to be gained these military types weren't going to advocate it. (I've seen a similar thery for the slower introduction of rifled musket). \\n More importantly than this there was a moral element. The allies didn't want to be seen as using the 'evil' and also illegal weapons first. In a way it is similar to the use of expanding ammunition. They were both illegal weapons, and supposedly more 'evil' and deadly, but were in fact, from a military standpoint, less effective than normal ammunition. The combination meant neither were widely used. \\n Why didn't Hitler use it then? Anecdotal evidence  suggets that his experienced beign gassed in WWI made him reluctant to allow its use except in retaliation. \\n EDIT: just ripped some figures from Wikipedia. For British military casualties the death rate from gas casualities was 3.3% or 6000/180000. THe more interesting figure of course would be what proportion could not return to the fighting - This may be closer to the 5% i remember from somewhere. \\n tl;dr it wasn't very effective, but it was very unpleasant so everyone tacitly refrained from using it. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('Yes and no.  Modern Italian has all the same Germanic influences as its Romance sister languages, as well as touches of Arabic, and Greek.  Each language had interactions with Latin speakers because of post-Roman Italian history. The question boils down to the degree in which these other languages influenced modern Italian. \\n It is also interesting to note that modern \"Italian\" is based of the Tuscan regional dialect, due to historical reasons.  Tuscany being a more economically developed and stable region, gave the dialect more prestige than the dozen of other dialects spoken throughout the region which would eventually become Italy.  Up until the Italian unification of the 19th century, Italy was a divided into many smaller kingdoms and regions, each with its own unique dialect.  Some of these dialects are more Germanic or Gallic -- enough to be considered other languages; Ligurian and Piedmontese being good examples. \\n Getting back to the original topic however, Italian is considered the closest descendant of Latin, keeping many features lost in other Romance languages.  However, many features of Italian are identical to the vulgar Latin that would eventually become French, Spanish, etc.  The use of \"si\" and definite articles for example.  This in turn separates Italian from the classical Latin for which we remember the Roman aristocracy and government to use in official purposes. \\n TL;DR  Italian is closer to Latin than the other Romance languages, but slightly. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"I just graduated with my MA in Musicology and decided not to pursue a Ph.D in part because of the prevalent attitudes and politics in the field. \\n Traditionally (19th Century-1970s or so) most music studies were focused on compiling factual biographical information and analyzing and promoting the works of a small canon (Beethoven etc.).  It was a male dominated field with almost no self-awareness in regards to gender and ethnic biases.  Great Germanic art music was great and everything else was just everything else. \\n Since the 1970s there has been a backlash against that and the current generation of 40-60 year old academics grew up in a reactionary period that saw the birth of popular music studies, music and gender and sexuality studies, and an increasing focus on the political, social, and historical contexts of music. \\n This is fine in theory, but the problem is that many of these academics had to fight tooth and nail against the older generation to do this and they've turned out a bit uncompromising and radical. In a lot of cases transparent political agendas and popularity narratives seem to trump good methodologically sound work. \\n From what I have seen, heard, and experienced first hand, there is hugely preferential treatment in terms of funding, support, and employment opportunities for those who devote themselves to elevating popular culture or reaching a radical and revisionist conclusion about some historical figure or work and their racial politics/gender identity/sexual identity/populist underpinnings.  On the flipside, those who are more interested in the plain mechanics of musical analysis or in studying challenging 'elite' and unpopular modernist repertoires are treated with suspicion, as if they might return the profession it's pretentious and privileged origins. \\n TLDR: Music scholars used to be racist, classist, sexist old white men with narrow taste, now they're the leftovers of the hippy generation who have swung too far the other way and are more interested in revisionism and inane po-mo than good scholarly work.

Here\\'s my take and I would appreciate any feedback. \\n There was a rather huge disconnect between royalty and the peasantry in the Dark Ages.  Oftentimes, they did not even speak the same  language. . \\n Furthermore, warfare was not typically something that the peasantry would often be conscripted for since convincing them to travel so far from their home and family would have been a hard sell indeed.  Peasants would most often have been used in the defense of an invasion for the much more tangible reasons that were stated by njrhall.  Instead a highly professionalized warrior class of society (the knights) would have been responsible for most of the fighting and the peasantry would, more often than not, find themselves as part of the \"spoils of war\".  Perhaps a peasant would find himself conscripted into the personal services of a knight, but the loyalty would be to this particular lord as opposed to a nation.  Peasant life was not very different between competing monarchs and politics was a field reserved for the literate nobility and nascent bourgeoisie. \\n TL;DR:  \"What\\'s a political climate?\"--typical peasant during the Middle Ages. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Caesar got to this before I could :P I blame work! \\n Okay, let\\'s start from the very beginning. That trailer. That made me cry a bit inside. \\n From the beginning! Rome was never a \"place of pristine beauty and freedom.\" It was beautiful when it could AFFORD to be beautiful, which is right around the time it started conquering things. Rome itself was filthy as HELL. And corruption was there since day  ONE.  The \"Old Families\" or  Patricians  were Rome\\'s ruling class since always - and the only reason the  plebians  had any rights at all is because they refused to fight unless they had a  tribune . So that first 30 seconds was a bit silly. \\n Secondly. We\\'re looking at the viewpoint of a centurion, seeing as he\\'s commanding more than 8 men. He\\'s probably a relatively high rank. Let\\'s look at their EQUIPMENT, shall we? \\n First off, the armour is all wrong. Seriously. It\\'s bloody irritating. They tried to make it better and just buggered it up.  THIS  rather than the mail that they...y\\'know...actually wore. They actually changed the design of the  lorica segmentata , if you look at it. Which irritates me to no end. Now that we\\'ve covered the fact that the armour is wrong (just look at the SHOULDERS dammit), let\\'s check out the SHIELDS, which are some of the most iconic pieces of the Roman equipment. Oh wait, they  buggered that part too.  Roman shields were decidedly  not  sheathed in steel, they were instead red and wooden, with a border of metal as well as a boss on the middle. [Here]( is a site that gives a decent rundown of the  scutum , as well as some pictures of replicas. Those are NOT the same shields that we see in that trailer. Speaking of which. They\\'re way too SMALL. The  scutum  covered a man from shoulder to below the knee. That little dinky piece of shield wouldn\\'t have covered half of that. \\n Speaking of which! They try to pretend they\\'re showing a  tetsudo  formation. Hee. Hee. That formation was looser than a New Orleans whore during Mardi Gras. The  tetsudo , by necessity, was a VERY tight formation that was virtually impenetrable by missiles. It was hot, it was heavy, yet there were none of those silly gaps that were all over the place in that trailer. \\n Next. The amphibious landing never happened, that\\'s just ridiculous. The closest you could get would be MAAAAAYBE Carthage. Maybe. That was a siege that lasted for years anyways. Catapults would not have been shooting flaming missiles everywhere. There was no D-Day back in Roman times. Arrows weren\\'t one shot one kill - they were generally more of a wounding weapon than anything else. (Unless you got hit in an unlucky spot, of course ;) ) If you had an arrow in your eye (Like that poor sod in the trailer) you wouldn\\'t be getting back up and thrashing around. Also, one shot from a catapult would not have destroyed an entire tower like that. Stones aren\\'t packed with explosives. \\n Next - Romans weren\\'t Rambo. They fought in formation, and it was that formation that cemented them as the rulers of the field in their time. One Roman would not have stormed everything by himself. Whirling around like that in a fight would also have gotten you killed many times over. Also. What the hell was up with that architecture? That was a mixture of Roman and High Middle Ages - more like something the French would build as a castle than anything else. No one built fortifications like that during the time of the Romans....well, except maybe the Romans around Rome. But these people you\\'re fighting are obviously meant to be barbarians because they have no clothes. What\\'s up with that, by the way? People who built a castle like that would most CERTAINLY wear clothes and armour. Plus, they would have FAR better weapons - axes were never really THAAAT popular. Spears and swords (More spears than swords) were the primary weapons of antiquity. \\n TL;DR  - The only Roman thing about it is how much it\\'s been Hollywoodized. \\n EDIT: One more thing. Roman statues were colourful, not monochrome marble. Goddammit. \\n EDIT II: Each soldier had TWO  pila . Not three, not unlimited. TWO. (Thanks for the reminder, /u/thesoulphysician :D ) \\n EDIT III: The  gladius  was a thrusting weapon. Like a short spear. Not a whirly flashy katana slashy weapon. A POKEY weapon. You POKED people with it. If you slashed someone like the guy in that trailer did, the sword would get stuck in the bone/muscle of whatever you were slashing. There\\'s a reason the Romans were trained to do nothing but POKE. Swords are not lightsabers. Roman swords weren\\'t even great quality steel. (Thanks /u/reginaldaugustus for pointing this one out ;) ) \\n EDIT IV: (Before I forget again.) Roman officers weren\\'t equipped with shields, which makes it all the more ridiculous that this guy started out with one. They instead had a  vitus , which was both a symbol of their office and a way for them to mete out punishment. \\n',\n  0),\n ('The Ostrogoths pretty much disappear from the record after their conquest by the Eastern Roman armies in the 535-554 Gothic War, followed by the soon-to-follow Lombard conquest of Italy in 568. \\n The Ostrogoths, like all barbarian tribes, were never \"that\" large a percentage of the population.  We\\'re talking something around 3% of the population, all at the top.  There were altering degrees of assimilation, in that they simultaneously became quite Romanized, but also were very keen on maintaining separation because of their status as elites of society.  This is why there was all that hubbub after the death of Theodoric over who should be his successor, because his appointed one, Athalaric, was viewed with alarm by other Goths as being too influenced by the Roman customs of culture than the Gothic ones of war.  However, the bulk of their administration was entirely Roman, so the culture was predominantly one of the elite classes to each other.  This is why once they were defeated as an elite class, they disappeared so quickly, melting back into the Roman. \\n Though obviously Goths continued to exist, most likely as middle landowners, they no longer appear as a political grouping, and apparently their archaeological culture vanishes without a trace after the Gothic war.  When the Franks come around to conquer Italy, the administrative structure they take over is Lombard and Byzantine, not Ostrogothic. \\n /u/domini_canes covers Visigothic Spain\\'s overview quite well.  Just to fill in some details.  Visigothic Spain was very similar to Italy in that they merged quite well with the existing Roman culture (Spain maintained and expanded on Roman law to a degree larger than the other former western provinces, although with questionable enforcement), so that when they themselves were conquered by the Arabs, the removal of their status as elite classes also destroyed much of their culture.  Obviously Asturias is a kingdom in the northwest of Spain with surviving Visigothic descent (which would later break up into kingdoms like Castille and Aragon which would go on to make up later medieval Spain), but apparently that area was already marginal to Visigothic Spain at the time, which was centered around Merida, and the Mediterranean coast.  Because of Asturias being far away from the \"main action\", they developed their own culture quite independently from the Visigothic overlay of the Roman foundations of the more occupied Southern part of Spain, despite the Visigothic noble descent of their founders. \\n I do not have more information on the Crimean Goths unfortunately. \\n tl;dr - the Goths were never that large a percentage of post-Roman society, and tended to occupy the leadership caste.

You might be interested in the  post I made earlier on something similar to this  I\\'ll quote it below :) If you have any other questions, feel free to ask - but it may be some time before I answer (just a heads up. Probably gonna be gone for 6-8 hours at the time of this post.) \\n \\n The oldest one I can tell you about is (shock and awe!) the counterculture movement in the late Republic period of the Romans. That might be a shock to you (Heck, counterculture movements go back that far? Now way!), but the reason we know about it is because of our fantastic records of Roman....well...everything. Unfortunately, many of the records we HAVE are from people who weren\\'t fond of said counterculture movement (such as Cicero\\'s letters), but I\\'ll happily quote some material so you can get an idea of who these people were! First off, I\\'m going to note - Cicero always spoke of these people with derision, very similarly to how a conservative in the modern day would speak of a hippy generation. The youth of the Late Republic were...well...not overfond of the establishment. The establishment and the culture of Rome was that men were clean shaven - indeed, all of the great men of Rome are portrayed as beardless, paintings of Romans almost always show them as completely clean-shaven, and the \"gateway ritual\" to manhood, as it were, was when a boy shaved for the first time. So, of course, these \"hotheaded youngbloods,\" as Cicero calls them, sported beards. \\n First off, there was a man named Catiline in Rome - who was at the centre of one of the most well-known conspiracies of all time (The Catiline conspiracy), and, without getting into too much detail on this, he (supposedly) tried to lead a revolt and kill a whole buncha Romans, but before he could, the Senate had him (and his followers) dragged from their beds and killed without a trial or anything (which was ANATHEMA to Romans. Citizens had RIGHTS dammit, and that was one of their inviolable ones - to always be allowed a trial, especially concerning the death penalty). So, these hotheaded youngbloods who supported him (generally the more liberal youth - they were called the  populares ) adopted a beard that was known as the \"Catiline chinstrap\" in protest and support of Catiline. Needless to say, this would have been the kind of drama that would have lasted for months on the front page of Reddit, or CNN, or BBC, or what have you. If there was a People Magazine precedent, Rome was IT. Anyways. \\n So there was this dude named Clodius who was a(nother) guy who would have been a gossipworthy celebrity. Think of a Roman (male) Lindsay Lohan. He (supposedly) slept with his sister, was involved in the most hilariously infamous incident of crossdressing ever (which caused G. J. Caesar to divorce his wife with the quote \"The wife of Caesar must be above suspicion\"), and just loved causing drama - he also did something that no Roman had ever done before. He lowered himself from the patrician rank (he was from one of THE most prestigious families in Rome) just so he could become tribune of the plebians, JUST so he could get back at Cicero. Yeah, he was a character. ANYWAYS. So the Senate tried to hold a trial for that crossdressing incident (they didn\\'t know WHAT the fuck to do. He was intruding on a sacred religious rite, and no one had ever done anything like this before), and the youth, who really liked Clodius, sported goatees instead. From Cicero\\'s letters! \\n > Affairs in Rome stand thus: The Senate is quite an Areopagus, throroughly resolute, strict, and courageous. When the day came for the bill to be put to the Assembly under the terms of the senatorial decree, there was a flocking together of our goateed young bloods, the whole Catilinarian gang with little Miss Curio at their head, to plead for its rejection. Consul Piso, the proposer of the bill, spoke against it. Clodius\\' roughs had taken posession of the gangways. The voting papers were distributed without any \\'ayes.\\' Suddenly up springs Cato [He was the strict, 100% moral, HUGELY conservative guy] to the platform and gives Consul Piso a spectacular dressing down, if one can apply such a term to a most impressive, powerful, in fact wholesome speech. \\n He goes on for a bit, but you get the concept ;) Clodius became (after he de-classed himself and got elected to the tribunate) almost a gang boss, taking over most of Rome with his gang of toughs (that was aforementioned), which devolved into one of the biggest gang wars that I can remember - It eventually became a contest between Pompey\\'s gang and Clodius\\' gang (who were financed by Crassus, the richest man in Rome, who didn\\'t like Pompey all that much, even though they were triumvirs together.) Fun story though! \\n Though another man who would be considered a role model to the rebellious youth of Rome would be a figure you\\'ve probably heard a lot about - Gaius Julius Caesar, who had grown up in a not-so-great part of town, yet was hugely popular with the people. He\\'s famous for being extravagent - and breaks with tradition constantly (Remember Cato, the traditionalist I was talking about earlier? Yeah, they pretty much hate each other\\'s guts.) When Caesar was a young man, there was a guy in charge of Rome (He sort of conquered the city and made himself dictator) who\\'s name was Cornelius Sulla. Sulla hated Caesar\\'s ass too - mostly because he thought that \"In that man goes many a Marius.\" (Gaius Marius is the guy who caused the civil war that made Sulla into a conquering dictator in the first place - and he\\'s the first one to have given the word \"Dictator\" a bad name. Sulla purged everyone who was affiliated with Marius, and it was really a bloody mess, but that\\'s besides the point.) Only reason he didn\\'t purge Caesar is because his friends like Caesar and convinced him not to. Caesar, at that point, was....well....for lack of a better term, he was a hippy, and many conservative Romans would have considered his manner of style feminine! (Goatees were considered feminine. As a man with a goatee, I personally find that hilarious.) He himself may have sported a goatee when he was young (we don\\'t have any sources, but the youth copied the everliving FUCK out of him, so...), though it\\'s also rumoured that he had every hair except the ones on top of his head plucked (pubes, armpit hair, chest hair, beard hair, leg hair, ass hair), he wore his toga long and flowing, with fabric that was \"transparent as a veil,\" (nuff said.) and he wore that toga \"loosely belted.\" He attached sleeves to his toga, and added a fringe, and he was EXTREMELY fastidious with his hair throughout his life - when he started to go bald, he wore a toupee, and carefully combed his hair over his bald spot to try to hide it. Speaking of his baldness....well...Roman beliefs were that the more promiscuous a man was, the more bald he was gonna get. Caesar pretty much slept with EVERYONE - heck, I\\'ll tell you a story about the Catiline conspiracy here. \\n So Caesar was actually suspected in the Catiline conspiracy as plotting against the Republic - and Cato (conservative dude) was one of the main speakers against him. Cato was on the Senate floor giving one of his speeches when suddenly, a messenger came in for Caesar and handed him a note. Cato, seizing on this to try to make Caesar look bad, pointed at Caesar and demanded he hand the note over and have it read before the Senate. Turns out...that note was a love letter. A GRAPHIC love letter. From Cato\\'s sister. \\n Awkwaaaaaaaard. \\n But yeah, there\\'s your example of an ancient counterculture. If you have any questions, don\\'t hesitate to ask! \\n \\n TL;DR - they certainly did! Rebelliousness was a well-documented area of Roman youth. Adrian Goldsworthy goes into GREAT detail on that in his book  Caesar: Life of a Colossus.  I\\'ll see if I can add some more quotes when I get back. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"I would say that the main East German party, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), would've been completely against reunification.  Since the end of World War II and the partition of Germany, the communists in East Germany (GDR) had always perpetuated the idea that East Germans were a different nationality than West Germans.  Their entire legitimacy had been in question since their inception, with most states recognizing the West German government in Bonn as the de jure regime of unified Germany.  Germany as a matter of fact was divided, so it was in the Russians' and East German communists' best interest to try to convince their population of this idea. \\n Stalin at times had tried to push for German reunification, believing that the socialists would take control, but he never acted on it.  His protege in the GDR, Walter Ulbricht, had been obsessed with reunification for his entire rule (1945-1971).  Never did Ulbricht seem to think that unifying Germany under his rule was not a possibility.  This refusal to embrace detente under Brezhnev was one of the reasons for his downfall.  Ulbricht was replaced with his own protege, Erich Honecker, who fully endorsed the idea of detente.  After Honecker took over, a deal was struck where the GDR and West Germany were both diplomatically recognized by the other bloc, allowing them both entry into the UN.  This was a major victory for detente, but only served to further the myth that East and West were separate people. \\n Honecker continued to follow the path of detente until his downfall in the late 1980s.  He was replaced by Egon Krenz, who was slightly reformist in the Gorbachev sense, but still clung to the idea of separate Germanies.  The SED's official line had always been their legitimacy over East Germany and East Germans, always making the point that they were distinct entities from their cultural neighbors. \\n I doubt the SED had any intention of reunification or any desire for it to happen.  The only reason the wall fell was due to a bungled press conference wherein a mid-level apparat accidentally said that travel was now open to the west.  It was a weird episode that had major consequences.  The wall fell, East Germany succumbed to reunification, and the communist half was no more.  The SED likely saw that reunification was unavoidable by 1989, but still did not want it to happen.  It was like covering your eyes so you can't see the train coming right at you.  Reunification meant their regime would be no more, because they would not win democratic elections, and their rule had always been based on a rigged system. \\n tl;dr:  East German party knew reunification was going to happen by the late 1980s, but they still didn't want it to.

The firing report was ruled unfounded during a debrief at 0940, but he did describe the ship as \"bulky, gray, and the bridge amidships\". \\n At 1055 hours, the Naval liaison at the Air Force HQ reported that the ship he saw that morning was a US audio-surveillance ship, of the US Navy, called the Liberty, with the markings GTR-5. At first, it was marked red, as an enemy ship. When it was identified as a US Navy ship, it was then marked green, as a neutral ship. The Acting Chief of Naval Operations received this report at 1100 hours, and he erased it from the table since he had no information on its whereabouts at the time of the report. \\n 7 counts are presented, and each is discussed in the report at this point. I will mention the counts, then the response. \\n 1: Complaint: The Acting Chief of Naval Operations ought have drawn the attention of the Head of the Naval Department to the fact that in the morning the \"Liberty\" was sailing near the Israeli coast. The omission occurred before the aircraft attack, and after the aircraft found the markings on the ship. \\n 1: Response: There was no reason to repeat this. The Head of the Naval Department had already been informed of the American supply ship in the area, and there was no reason to re-apply this information at any point. When the markings were reported, the Naval Liaison repeated loudly that the Liberty was previously near the Israeli coast, so why repeat it? No one reported that the Liberty should be in the area of the target. \\n 2: Complaint: It was argued that it was the duty of the Naval Liaison Officer to present to the Air Force the information regarding the Liberty. \\n 2: Response: There was no reason for him to do that. It is not in his role, and the responsibility for identification and attack lay with the Navy. Air Force HQ, who it was said they should have told about the Liberty, was merely relaying orders from Navy HQ. Telling them about Liberty would have been unnecessary, because they were doing nothing more than relaying Navy orders. \\n At this point, the report moves to the sixth count, because it seems to fit the flow. \\n 6: Complaint: The Torpedo Boat Division Commander should have been given an order by the Naval Department not to attack a ship, suspected by the former to be an enemy vessel, for fear of error and uncertainty as to its true identity. \\n 6: Response: In the operations log-book of the flag boat carrying the Division Commander on board, it was recorded that at approximately 1420 hours an order in the following terms was received from Naval Operations Branch: \"Do not attack. It is possible that the aircraft have not identified correctly.\" A similar entry, made at the same time, is to be found in the war diary of Naval Operations Branch, as an instruction transmitted to the Division. The Division Commander, however, mentioned that no such order reached him. The person responsible for the communication with the Division Commander testified that the order was relayed to the Division Commander. There is significant chance that the witnesses to this chain were not credible, but assuming they were, it is possible that the order was ignored in the heat of battle and due to danger. However, this count may actually be founded. \\n Back to the third count. \\n 3: Complaint: There was not enough investigation of the report of El-Arish being shelled before retaliation was ordered. \\n 3: Response: There is no reason to assume a report of something so serious as shelling is  incorrect , but even so, the order was received from Air Force HQ and then verified through the second source (Southern Command), so there was no reason to assume the information was incorrect. \\n 4, 5, and 7 are grouped together. They are: \\n >The fourth and fifth counts are alternative and allege negligence, in that an order to attack a target thought to be an enemy target was given without checking its national identity and without taking into account that the ship \"Liberty\" was observed in the morning hours of that day sailing in the vicinity of the Israel coast. \\n >Finally, in the seventh count, the Chief Military Prosecutor charges that \"aircraft of the Air Force and torpedo boats attacked the American ship \"Liberty\" on an unfounded assumption--resulting from failure to take reasonable steps properly to establish her identity--that she was an Egyptian warship.\" \\n As you can see, they\\'re very similar. The response was (in tl;dr form) that many attempts had been made to identify the ship, it was misidentified because of the speed of the ship (it was going too fast to be anything but a military vessel) and there was no reason to believe otherwise. Even if the Liberty had been 20 miles north of El-Arish, it likely wouldn\\'t have changed the way the torpedo ships saw the ship, because it appeared as a warship and was traveling in a manner consistent with that assumption, and the torpedo boat eyewitness accounts attributed it to warship-status. \\n It is argued against this that the ship couldn\\'t have been moving that fast. It is also argued that it was alone, and it would make no sense for it to be alone if it was involved in shelling. The Yerushalmi Report specifies that there were numerous explanations for this, including that it broke off from other ships that were shelling, that it lagged behind, etc. (if it were a warship, it wouldn\\'t be against reason to believe these had happened to explain its position). It was also possible that it was assisting in evacuating soldiers fighting Israeli forces from the area. \\n Yet another counterargument is this: The ship refused to identify itself. It was the fault of the Americans for refusing to identify themselves even after being attacked, in the hopes that the attack might be stopped. It goes against naval custom to do so if you are a neutral naval ship. \\n Also, the Division Commander (in the Sinai War) had requested of the Egyptian destroyer \"Ibrahim El-Awal\" to identify itself, and had received the \"identify yourself first\" response. It was therefore more likely for him to assume it was an Egyptian ship. \\n With this, the Yerushalmi Report roughly ends, and we can launch into the American version of the attack. \\n',\n  0),\n ('There absolutely were! \\n The reason Rome is so remarkable is that it was the juggernaut of its age; almost every gain you saw on that map is the result of a major, brutal war against one of its neighbors. That being said, the characteristics of those people were often very different from Rome herself. \\n The most directly comparable nations to Rome in her own time were generally centered around the Mediterranean. The reasons for this are controversial, but one of the most common explanations is the fact that the Med provides an easy seaborne trade route. We forget in our modern age of planes, trains, and automobiles how arduous overland transport used to be; when your only option to ship bulk goods on land was a long, slow, and often painful wagon ride, you might be forgiven for preferring to put your wheat or marble or wine amphorae (jars) on a faster and larger ship to cover the same distance for a fraction of the time and effort. \\n For this reason (and probably also because of the immensely fertile soil and high levels of sunshine and rain throughout the year), large, agriculturally-based societies sprung up in places like modern Italy, Greece, Egypt, and Tunisia. These Big Four (Rome, Greece, Egypt, and Carthage) had attained by the tail end of the Hellenistic period (for our purposes, say 160 BCE) a high degree of urbanization - that is to say, their cities had developed into hubs of trade and commerce above and beyond the traditional village role as a smallish hub of a subsistence farming community. Cities like Alexandria and Rome had attained populations in the ballpark of one million people by some estimates, a remarkable achievement for their times. This population growth was partially a result of the conquest of each empire\\'s immediate neighbors: if you don\\'t have to worry about raids from the Samnites next door every year, your city needn\\'t stay strictly inside a tight defensive perimeter, and a larger portion of your army can be devoted to campaigns further away from home. \\n Without getting into a full political science lecture of each empire of Classical Antiquity, it will suffice to say that each of these empires were tightly centralized by the standards of their time: the city of Rome directly ruled all the land south of the river Rubicon, and beyond that frontier to the north and across the Adriatic and Mediterranean their holdings were ruled by  proconsuls , roughly equivalent to a military governor. Much the same could be said of Carthage and its holdings in North Africa and Spain, though the latter would become something of a \"rebellious province\" on account of the personal ambitions of the Barca military family (Hamilcar, and his famous sons Hannibal and Hasdrubal). Egypt and Greece, on the other hand, were political remnants of Alexander the Great\\'s empire, and though their structures were monarchical rather than council-based, they still wielded a commanding influence over their subjects. \\n On the other hand, many civilizations to the north of the Mediterranean had not yet reached this level of political and economic sophistication yet. Tribes like the  Cimbri  and the  Teutones  lived in largely migratory communities; they would move around the lands currently known as Germany, France, and Switzerland in search of better grazing lands for their livestock and better soil for their crops once each had been depleted in their old location. Occasionally these groups would get very large indeed, numbering some hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children with some tens of thousands of fighting men each. It\\'s tempting to view them as barbarians plain and simple, but I\\'ve seen some convincing cases made that these groups closely resembled Greece as it was on the threshold of democracy. As Rome expanded her frontiers beyond Italy itself, the borders of the empire (with a small \"e\", as Rome was still a Republic at this time) rubbed up against the lands of several of these tribes, and a market formed as markets are wont to do. We have significant archaeological evidence of Roman wine amphorae and jewelry from Greece being traded in communities as far north as modern Belgium when the frontiers of Rome herself were still hundreds of miles away; likewise, we have evidence of coal from Britain first coming to be used in Roman jewelry around the same time period. But as with any instance of close contact between a wealthy civilization and a poor civilization, the poor will soon come to covet that for which they have developed a taste but cannot make themselves. \\n Some time around 110 BCE, the  Cimbri  tribe had completed a migration down from its homeland in modern Denmark and northern Germany and arrived in modern central France, within a few months\\' march of Rome. By all accounts the  Cimbri  were a very large tribe, perhaps numbering over three hundred thousand when combined with a neighboring group, the  Teutones . It was shortly after their arrival in this region that the nearby Roman proconsul and the Senate back in Rome started to become understandably nervous about the prospect of - as they saw it - a horde of screaming barbarians, 300,000 strong, descending on their territory. This is, in fact, exactly what happened: the  Cimbri  and the  Teutones  dealt Rome several crushing defeats in encounter after encounter, killing tens of thousands of Roman legionaries in the process. So badly depleted was Rome\\'s fighting strength that a man named Gaius Marius was chosen to handle the problem and reform the military to fight another day. These reforms would have huge consequences on Rome\\'s politics within a few decades, but in the short term they allowed Marius to defeat first the  Cimbri  and the  Teutones  who had made the fatal blunder of sparing Italy when it was wide open in favor of plundering Spain instead. \\n Some years later, the Roman proconsul of the province of Cisalpine and Transalpine Gaul became worried of a repeat of the Cimbrian and Teutonic Wars when a tribe called the  Helvetii  began to migrate from modern Switzerland to France by way of Roman territory. It wasn\\'t an irrational fear: this governor may not have remembered the war against the  Cimbri  himself, but he was the nephew of Gaius Marius by marriage and understood intimately the threat such an event could pose. The  Helvetii  were not such a small tribe themselves, probably over one hundred thousand people, and to defeat them the proconsul enlisted the help of other Gallic tribes allies to Rome. Over time, the need to protect these allied tribes and to pacify the lands Rome had  de facto  come to rule through the defeat of their kings and leaders. \\n The British Empire was once described as having \"conquered the world in a fit of absence of mind\". Julius Caesar\\'s conquest of Gaul (modern France, Belgium, and parts of the Netherlands and Germany) might well fit that description; though it certainly helped his career greatly, there is little evidence to suggest that he intended from the get-go to conquer quite as much land as he eventually would. \\n What is not in doubt is that there were hundreds of thousands of people on that land. Caesar himself wrote yearly dispatches to the city of Rome (largely intended for a public audience rather than as military briefings) called Commentaries; this compendium of works has survived down to the present day, and the one thing it makes very clear is how many Gallic tribespeople died during the Roman conquest of their homeland. Some accounts place the number of \"tribes\" within Gaul as high as 60, each with tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people under their control. What must be understood is that these were whole civilizations in and of themselves; it is not for nothing that Caesar\\'s eight-year conquest of the whole of Gaul is widely recognized as one of the most incredible of all historical feats of generalship. \\n By Caesar\\'s own figures, the number of those killed during his campaigns may well have reached as high as one million. Some modern historians think this number a little high, but it is not in doubt that the Gallic legions were directly responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of fighting men and perhaps far more women and children to boot. \\n tl;dr: Yeah, and it really sucked to be one of them when Rome came knocking. \\n Sources: I leaned pretty heavily on the works of Adrian Goldsworthy here; his book \"Caesar\" is a great read if you ever feel inclined to learn more about Rome during his time period. I also have a pretty solid grasp of Caesar\\'s  Commentaries  themselves - the prose is a little spartan, but it\\'s a must-read for anyone into military history. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Religious justifications for slavery are as old as the institution itself.  In the 17th century Anglo-American case, there were three main biblical justifications (though both were hotly contested even then).  Emphasis on any one justification varied with time and, as your question implies, shifted with changes to the structure of slavery and other available \"racial\" justifications. \\n First, and most important for later developments, was the Old Testament\\'s explicit sanction for \"bond slaves\" in Leviticus, 25. Mosaic law clearly allowed the enslavement of non-Israelite \"strangers.\" Leviticus also includes regulations for treatment of bond slaves and requires their conversion and eventual assimilation into ancient Israelite society. In other words, biblical slavery was not heritable like modern racial slavery. This isn\\'t quite a \"racial\" argument, because, at the time, lines of inclusion and exclusion tended to be as much about religion as race. (Warning: controversial assertion ahead) Like the ancient Israelites, some early American colonists seem to have believed that conversion to Christianity freed slaves and redeemed them from \"social death.\"  Because of this unstable basis, other justifications were needed. \\n This leads to the second main justification for specifically RACIAL slavery - the so-called Curse of Ham.  In Genesis, 9:20-27, just after the flood story, Noah gets drunk and passes out naked in his tent.  Ham, Noah\\'s son, sees his father\\'s naked body and mocks him (although biblical exegetes have a number of really far out interpretations here...).  In revenge Noah lays a curse on Ham\\'s son, Canaan, saying \"a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.\" Some early European explorers used the Curse of Ham to explain Africans\\' dark skin, and once the trans-Atlantic slave trade was underway, the two factors came together to form a potent biblical explanation/justification for both racial difference AND slavery.  (To be fair, there were always English subjects who disagreed with this interpretation - see for example, Morgan Godwyn\\'s \"The Negro\\'s and Indian\\'s Advocate\" [1681] available through Google Books.) \\n Finally, and this one is a bit further out there, some (admittedly heterodox) early modern thinkers believed that other \"species\" of humans existed BEFORE God created Adam and Eve. These theories of \"pre-Adamite man\" or \"polygenesis,\" while not widely accepted in the 17th century, became increasingly accepted as Enlightenment and 19th century \"science\" increasingly \"proved\" that different races were distinct species. You don\\'t often see these later thinkers making explicit claims that Africans were descended from pre-Adamite man, but by the 1830s a more secularized version of polygenesis was an important element of proslavery ideology. \\n (For more on these questions broadly, see David Brion Davis,  The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture  and  Inhuman Bondage .) \\n Now for your very interesting question about whether conversions forced slave owners to adopt new justifications for slavery.  First off, let\\'s just be clear that, until the 1830s or so, very few slaves actually converted to Christianity, and after the 1660s, every colony/state had laws guaranteeing that conversion would not free slaves.  That said, from all the primary sources I\\'ve seen, from pamphlets to court records to imperial decrees, there seems to have been a lingering doubt about the legitimacy of enslaving fellow Christians.  In a series of English legal cases in the early 1700s, Sir John Holt, Chief Justice of King\\'s Bench, declared that Christian slaves in England would have all the rights of any Christian subject, much like Leviticus said about converted slaves - clearly not a stable basis for plantation slavery.  My feeling (and at this point it is JUST a feeling...at least until my book gets published) is that \"racial\" arguments first emerged clearly in response to these antislavery arguments from Christianity. Some of this is also a shift in the tools available to slaveholders. The Enlightenment put \"science\" on the table in a new way, allowing proslavery ideologues to make arguments about human difference without resorting directly to biblical text. \\n In the early 19th century and through to the Civil War, religious justifications for slavery remained potent, particularly the Curse of Ham. Indeed, it was EASIER to make a proslavery argument from the Bible, particularly in an age of biblical literalism, than an antislavery argument.  If it was such a big deal, slave owners said, wouldn\\'t Jesus have said something about it? Didn\\'t St. Paul say \"servants be obedient to your masters even unto death\"? Weren\\'t many early Christians slaves, and didn\\'t they remain so even after their conversion? (See Mark Noll,  America\\'s God )  All this together, for slave owners, made for a potent religious justification, but notice, not a specifically  racial  justification. \\n To be balanced, it is important to note that antislavery thinkers also based their arguments in religious or biblical thought.  The Quakers, for example, focused on the Golden Rule and denied that Christians could use violence against others, making slavery very difficult to justify.  Famously, many evangelicals in the Second Great Awakening in the US found antislavery principles in Christianity.  And, of course, enslaved people themselves fashioned an explicitly antislavery Christianity. \\n So it turns out you can find a bunch of different, often contradictory messages in the Bible...go figure... \\n TL;DR - Early proslavery thinkers used the Bible extensively to justify the enslavement of Africans. Slave conversions weren\\'t much of a problem, and it was the emergence of an ANTI-slavery religious argument that forced slave owners to craft more explicitly racial justifications. \\n',\n  0),\n ('I\\'m a linguistics major and am writing a thesis on linguistic reconstruction at the moment, though I admittedly know very little about Native American languages or Japanese.  Still: \\n >Both languages use the verb at the end of the word, a feature only 45% of language share and Zuni is like no other language in the area. \\n Er... 45% is a lot, in fact SOV is the cross-linguistically the most common word order (just).  Also, [SOV word order is common in the area]( \\n >Some Zuni words sound like Japanese words, way above chance. \\n It might be way above chance, but neither the Cracked article nor the article it links to provide a word list to check.  Neither make any mention of attempts to look for sound correspondences. \\n It might sound counter intuitive, but often if you\\'re looking at two languages and positing a distant genetic relationship, you often expect two words with same meaning to look fairly different.  Why?  For one, because words change meaning and get replaced over time.  It\\'s been established that more basic words get replaced/change meaning more slowly but \"clown\" is in no way basic and neither is \"priest\" or even \"clan\" really. Therefore, for distant relationships, it is not likely that two words that mean the same are actually related. \\n Secondly, sounds change slowly over time and fairly systematically.  Furthermore, when words get borrowed, they usually are adapted phonologically to the language they are borrowed into.  Again, I don\\'t know enough about Zuni to say for sure, but based on the examples it seems off that /n/, /w/ and /k/ (by the way, the \\'kw\\' in Zuni is a labialised [k] according to Wiki while in Japanese it seems to be a consonant cluster so the sounds, while similar, are not even the same)  would still correspond exactly to one another after all this time.

Personally I believe European colonization was abhorrent and lead to the current disastrous post colonial state of several parts of the African continent, but there are many I\\'ve encountered who would argue otherwise. \\n The two extremes often brought forth in this kind of debate would be South Africa and Somalia. The European colonization of South Africa began in the late 17th century with the Boer settlements in the Western Cape of Good Hope. Initially through the Boers, and then eventually the British empire, many western trends, technologies, and cultural elements were introduced to the land. Then South Africa was controlled by the minority-ruled Apartheid government, which suppressed the majority of the population, but ultimately pushed for economic growth and control of the entire southern African region. Although the apartheid regime was brutal, the country was largely successful. During this time, South Africa became a sort of hegemony on the continent, ultimately leading to its current developed economy and relatively high amount of sway and influence in the modern world. In this case, some would argue that colonialism drastically accelerated the growth of South Africa ultimately leading to its current relatively successful state. \\n And then we have Somalia. Somalia always had historic ties to the various Islamic empires that dominated the region until the early 20th century, and as a result was able to repel colonization attempts by the Portuguese and British Empires. In 1929 the local Dervish empire was finally defeated by the British Empire. At this point the Italian empire came to control all of the formerly Dervish lands. Italian influence can still be seen in the architecture of the Somalian capital of Mogadishu. The ruling Somalian-Italian regime was toppled after the second world war, upon which Somalia gained its independence. Although initially it seemed that Somalia would thrive under the \"democratic leadership\" of Aden Abdullah Osman Daar, power was soon seized by Mohamed Siad Barre who ruled with an iron fist until a total collapse of government and order occurred in 1991. This is the kind of aforementioned disastrous post-colonial state that many would use as an argument against colonialism. It is my personal belief that Somalia could have had a prosperous future were it not for the interference of competing European powers. \\n TL;DR: Colonialism, depending on who you ask, could be considered good or bad for developing nations. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"Well...your question sort of dodges the answer in that a large population doesn't necessarily translate into a large fighting force (it's not a 1:1 ratio). The truth was (from what I've learned) that while the Germans didn't have superior overall manpower, they had a long history of military genius and prowess behind them - even before Bismarck (This guy is fantastic at what he did, though. If you want to read up on Germany's consolidation, look into him. Hell, he predicted WWI way before anyone else saw it coming! It's too bad that Wilhelm II kicked him out...it would have been interesting to see what would have happened had he remained in his position). German soldiers were simply more disciplined and better trained than their opponents -  especially  the Russians, who were often going into battle with crude weapons, hoping to pick up guns from their fallen foes or comrades. \\n On the resources side, the problem with Great Britain was that the only thing they had was coal. Seriously, they had trees and that was pretty much it. Russia had resources, but they were nowhere near as organized as Germany. France was under siege for most of both wars and thus couldn't utilize its resources. This was, of course, in addition to the German repossession/takeover (read: French loss) of critical  industrial areas like the Ruhr and Alsace-Lorraine. Germany had really great war resources (plenty of iron to go around), but lacked serious dual-use (military and civilian applications) resources like rubber, petrol, and grain. The U.S. had the resources and the men, but the country didn't officially enter the war until both sides had exhausted themselves (for a hilarious take on this, read [If World War I was a Bar Fight]( \\n This brings us to the unprecedented death counts and those few lucky enough to go back home. Think about it like this: your fiance or your husband has been gone for some time (let's say two years). He's mentally exhausted from the trench warfare and constant artillery bombardment and traumatized from the things he's seen/done while away. He also hasn't had real, sustained contact with a woman for who knows how long. 25 years is enough time to raise a child, not to mention a few million, past conscription age. \\n This is all disregarding the politics of the time; Britain not really wanting to go to war but not clearly advertising that they would if Germany became aggressive; France not wanting to fight Germany unless its new buddy Britain came along, the U.S. running the blockade for Germany until it was convinced to switch sides, etc. \\n TL;DR  In addition to their military power (not necessarily their  man power), Germany relied heavily upon the fact that their enemies weren't as good at waging warfare as Germans were. As you simply can't place an entire population on the battlefield, it was more a matter of how many men signed up/were drafted and this was greatly helped by the nationalism (Volksgeist) that was spread through Europe on the heels of Napoleon and stirred up in Germany by Bismarck and his underlings. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"The [Great Chinese Famine]( of 1958 to 1961 happened due to not complacency, but outright denial, in so far as saying food was bountiful. \\n Basically this was due to Mao's Great leap Forward and the 4 No's campaign,  firstly you had the 4 No's campaign, it was a massive campaign to wipe out pests, rats, flies, mosquito's and importantly sparrows.

In a general sense, both Hitler and Stalin knew that war between their respective countries was simply a matter of time. Their ideologies and competing geopolitical interests made it quite simple. Even when they sicked the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact, they both understood that it was simply buying time. Hitler needed time to deal with western Allies, and Stalin wanted to recover land Russia had lost after WWI and the Russian Revolution. Stalin also wanted to buy time to reorganize and modernize the Red Army with better equipment. \\n However what Stalin didn\\'t anticipate was how quickly Hitler would be done with France. But even after the fall of France, things didn\\'t look particularly threatening. Germany was still at war with Great Britain and, apparently, was preparing to invade the British Isles. The USSR was dutifully sending valuable raw materials to Germany. Finally, Germany didn\\'t make any diplomatic moves that would signal a worsening relationship. Hitler made no territorial demands as he had with Poland. There were no ultimatums. Lastly, intelligence wasn\\'t very clear. Up until around May 1941, Germany only had infantry divisions in Eastern Europe which looked like simply a defensive screen while Germany setting up to invade England. \\n At this point, it is important to understand that Germany\\'s military was fully mobilized. I never demobilized since invading Poland, and was continuously at war and involved in various campaigns in France, the Balkans etc. The Red Army by contrast wasn\\'t mobilized and only took part in much more limited campaigns against Poland and then against Finland. Why wasn\\'t the Red Army mobilized? Well it is imply too expensive to keep millions of men under arms when the country is not at war. Secondly, if the Soviet leadership did declare mobilization, Germany could easily interpret that as a sign that the USSR was planning to attack Germany. The Soviet Union wasn\\'t in a state of war with anyone in 1941, so why would it mobilize? But because the USSR was such a large country, it needed a lead time of 30-35 days for for troops in the interior to assemble and move toward the border. \\n Sometime in June 1941, it did become apparent that Germany was looking to invade. In response, the USSR took steps at mobilizations under the guise of military training exercises. But, again, because Germany was still at war with GB and because there was no diplomatic pretext for war, the Stalin was hesitant to call for a full open mobilization which would make war a certainty and make him look like an aggressor. He also felt that Hitler wasn\\'t foolish enough to launch an invasion of such a large country as the USSR without first ending the war with GB. Finally, by the time Stalin had enough intelligence to conclude that Hitler was indeed about to invade, which was in the middle of June, the month long window of time needed to complete the mobilization had already closed. Nothing Stalin did or didn\\'t do a few days before the actual invasion would have made much differences simply because it was too late. \\n TL;DR \\n \\n Germany was still at war with GB when it invaded the USSR \\n There was no diplomatic tension or other pretexts for war that would suggest that an invasion was imminent. \\n Intelligence sources were ambiguous about Hitler\\'s intentions until it was too late. \\n The Red Army needed at least a month lead time to prepare for an invasion while Germany\\'s military was already fully mobilized. \\n Stalin didn\\'t want to, by declaring mobilization, to make war an inevitably and look like an aggressor.  \\n \\n',\n  0),\n ('As late antiquity merged into the \"early medieval\" period, Roman Gaul (and the empire in general) became more militarized.

Germany and Japan were allies for the following reasons: They both wanted rid of the Soviet Union, they both had ambitions at odds with the major world powers (mostly the British Empire), and they had goals that did not conflict. \\n Hitler's interests did not lie in Asia, of which he knew little and understood even less. That made Japan the perfect partner, because he didn't care what they might get up to in a post-war world. The alliance was just a convenience to join against common enemies. \\n As a bonus concerning your comment that the Japanese were clearly not the least bit Aryan: the Nazi propaganda machine closed this hole up quite nicely to justify the alliance with Japan. Japanese people, they argued, were so-called Culture Carriers. Aryans, for reference were called Culture Creators (the best), Jews of course were Culture Destroyers, most others were considered essentially uncultured (the rest of Asia, for example). Status as Culture Carriers meant the Japanese were not capable of creating anything new, but could be counted on to take up the Aryan way. This is hardly flattering to the Japanese, by the way, and was not a part of international rhetoric, just domestic stuff. \\n Tl;dr: Hitler didn't have plans for the Japanese after the war because he didn't care what happened to Asia after the war. His focus was on Europe. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('Really depends what time were talking about. Peter Brown argues in \"World of Late Antiquity\" that traditionalist view Romans (pagans) especially during the period before the Third Century Crisis actually converted to Christianity to sort out all of the the new anxiety that was sweeping the nation. \\n Something as simple as a \"revelation\" or \"inner rebirth\" appealed to sort out the problems of the declining nation. \\n The \\'new mood\\' that Christianity was also bringing to this early middle age period made men focus all there anxieties on there own bodies ( using the humors inside themselves for healing), this pushed forward the idea of creating a boundary around yourself (dividing yourself from the demons), Christianity appealed to this new personal way of looking at your life. \\n \"To men increasingly preoccupied with the problem of evil, (everything from earthquakes to barbaric invasions to themselves going insane was considered the work of demons) the Christian attitude to the demons offered an answer to relieve nameless anxiety\" (The World of Late Antiquity, pg. 54-55) \\n TL;DR basically by converting to Christianity the late roman residents manned the barricades in an \"invisible battle with the demons\" (The World of Late Antiquity) who thought to bring everything from diseases to mental problems.

Some definitions put things in, like Keegan\\'s understanding of war as also an act of cultural mobilisation. Some definitions are reductive, like Clausewitz\\'s famous \"war is policy by other means\" (- he plagiarized this from Scharnhorst). \\n So if we look at the Cold War - certainly, like /u/MisterMomo says, there were elements of the metaphoric there in the name; after all, it was a \"cold\" war, not \"hot\". The two major powers didn\\'t fight each other direct. But by all the military science definitions of war, the Cold War qualifies not just as that, but as  actually a war . \\n The Cold War used violence and the threat of violence to achieve political effects. Directly fought proxy wars by both the USSR and the USA attempted to shore up their own influence at the expense of the competitor. Nuclear missiles and the MAD doctrine used the threat of violence to secure strategic territory against attack. The explicit cultural mobilisation - \"freedom, democracy, individualism, the free market\", verses \"collectivism, communism, the New Soviet Man, central planning\" - was done on a grand scale. The Cold War was also a period of government policy enacted through other means; activities occurring within its contexts, such as the Space Race, for example, and the \"Star Wars\" programme, are campaigns fought against an enemy. You could use any useful definition of war, and find the Cold War fits into it. \\n As for your question \"is it considered to be on the scale of other wars\"; that is tricky, and depends on how you\\'re scaling things. Politically? It was on a  huge  scale. It literally forced almost the entire world to choose a side, and kept them bound to that side for forty or sixty years (depending on when you reckon the Cold War started). Militarily? Still huge in the expenditure of treasure undertaken, and by overall worldwide military size.  Casualties? Not many. But casualties actually have nothing to do with war, except for being an unfortunate side effect. This might seem callous, and for that I am sorry, but killing other people is only the medium through which an organisation attempts to break an opponent to their will. So we can\\'t really use that as a measure of scale (although everyone sure as shit  wants  too). It would be like saying the house you built must be huge because you used the biggest hammer. \\n Regardless, it depends on what you personally consider to be the thing to be measured, for the scale part of your question. \\n TL:DR; yes. \\n',\n  0),\n ('While your post explains broadly why the Cold War situation developed, it\\'s also worth it to zoom in on some of the details that contributed to what happened. For example, what happened in Germany during the first 2 years after the end of WW2. \\n As most people know, the ruins of Berlin were divided in sectors between Soviet, French, British and American forces, initially unified under a joint Allied administration. Together they agreed to find, arrest and prosecute former nazis who helped run Hitler\\'s persecutory regime. High ranking nazis as well as middle ranking ones were targeted for arrest in a process termed  denazification . \\n Basically West Berlin was a small island in the middle of Soviet occupied country. French, British and American trucks drove through Soviet lines to bring supplies to Berlin. Millions upon millions of German refugees from the annexed eastern territories flooded into the city, worsening the humanitarian situation. The Allies (and Soviets) were all focused on getting basic infrastructure (water supply, food delivery, housing construction) up and running ASAP. In the chaos, they could not cope with the huge amount of refugees, and because of that they couldn\\'t always check all refugee carefully to see if they had been nazis. In some cases, the Allies were so short staffed and lacking in people with administrative, industrial and German language skills, that they started putting obvious nazis into important positions. This problem was especially apparent in the Western sectors of Berlin. \\n The soviets however, put in much more effort to detain former nazis, even those that were needed in order to repair Germany\\'s infrastructure. Soviet soldiers were sent out to the addresses of people identified as nazis in order to arrest them. However, the Western Sectors of Berlin were known to be (more or less) safe havens because western Allied denazification efforts were more lax than those on the Soviet side. Frustrated by this, the Soviets sometimes sent squads into other country\\'s sectors in order to \"extract\" suspected nazis. These incidents were one of the first causes of rivalry between the Soviets and the West, although both countries initially did their best to stay on (at least overtly) friendly diplomatic terms. Sometimes there were serious confrontations between Soviet \"extractors\" and British/American troops, even violent. \\n The Soviets, being a communist country, tried their best to help German socialists and communists who had been oppressed by the nazis. In 1946, the Soviets sponsored the merger between the SPD (a social democratic political party) and the KPD (German Communist Party). This would have the effect of encouraging moderate leftwing voters to vote for a party that was essentially a stalinist one. The merger was opposed by Berliners in a referendum. In response to this referendum, the Soviets ignored the results and issued a joint Allied declaration that the merger was to be put into effect immediately. Then they started organizing communist-alligned police forces, secret police organizations, the beginnings of what would be the East German army... Basically installing a socialist regime in their sector. Restrictions were put on the amount of American trucks that could drive through Soviet territory into Berlin. Any proposals by the West to these orders were vetoed immediately. Basically the Soviet Union used a strategy to install a socialist-alligned regime, and to subtly urge the Western Allies to leave Berlin. The Allies did not relent, not for 50 years. \\n Source: Faust\\'s Metropolis: A History of Berlin by Alexandra Richie \\n Tl;dr: the stuff I\\'ve summed up is the \"Berlin angle\" to the start of the Cold War. Increasing disagreement and rivalry between both sides on how post-war Germany should be run escalated into serious military tension. \\n But there was certainly stuff going on in other parts of the world, and in the wider political-economic sphere that also contributed to the start of the Cold War dynamic. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Geography mostly. \\n Horse archers were usually tribel people that lived on the steppe, now if you look at the great steppe you will see that it stoppes right befor europe and then there are the Carpathian Mountains making a nice shild. Unfortunatly for europe there is a little steppe ofshoot behind these mountains, now called the hungarian steppe, and that is where all the great steppe empires set up shop and raided the west. While these raids were possible, they never really had the same power as they did on the steppes. Northern europe was full of woods, then you have the alpes and so on. So the utility of a horse archer goes down somewhat. \\n In europe horses were always a luxury good. You can even see that in the organisation of the early roman army. You can see it in Alexanders army. The same goes for the middle ages. This alone would not make the devlopment impossible, even a small mount of horse archers are better then non at all. Another thing is that horse archery is extremly hard and training men to do it, is costly. The only major empires who actually trained natives as horse archers, are the Byzantians (around Justinians time) and they only had small numbers and prefered using huns or avars. \\n There are more problems. The weapon that really changed the amount of danger coming from horse archers is the power of the bow. The romans allready had trouple with the scythians but the huns were on a hole other class, they seamed to use a better bow. These kinds of bows were hard to make and so far as I know the secret of making composite bows of that style never really arrived in the empires around the steppe. They used bows like it but did not make them. This is another advantage of the tribes living on the steppe, they needed these bows and lots of people could make them. \\n One last point on tribal organisation. They way these tribes thougth was very dynamic, more like a swarm and that did help them in battle. They could break up, change there direction and all kind of movments that really required a amount of coordination that western nobels could not match. Even western nobels who trained fighing on horses from a jung age, had huge problems to pull of a charge. The sort of dynamic hit and run with ambushes was really not something you can learn, if you are not living on horses together as a army or a tribe. \\n tl:dr; Not enougth horses, lacking the bow technology, to costly to train, to hard to organise \\n',\n  0),\n ('In addition to my comment on the question itself, I have an answer that dates to the beginning of the modern international system (or just before, if we take the Peace of Westphalia as our starting point). \\n During the 30 Years War, England supported the cause of the Elector Palatine against the Holy Roman Emperor in a phase of the conflict that centered on the invitation of the Elector to take the throne of Bohemia, over the protests of the Hapsburg monarchy.  During the second phase of the war, France and Sweden both intervened under the pretext of defending \"German liberties,\" inserting themselves into Imperial politics (and advancing their territorial claims) by military means. \\n The famous Spanish Armada offers an even earlier example; to use the language of the Cold War heyday for American interventions, the Catholic Spanish wanted to impose a client regime over England, thereby replacing the ideologically rival Anglican-Protestant monarchy.  In less anachronistic terms, the Spanish saw Elizabeth I as an illegitimate usurper of Queen Mary I of England (also the wife of Phillip II of Spain).  Ironically, the invasion was not only ideologically motivated (and, in turn, endorsed morally and economically by the Papacy... another case of intervention) but strategical impelled by English aid to the rebellious Spanish Netherlands. \\n As I write this, I realize that one could go much further by following the thread of Papal interventions throughout European history and, for that matter, interventions against the Papal State and/or the Catholic hierarchy (often to secure the election of a preferred candidate to the Holy See).  A few examples... \\n Papal condemnation of the Cathar Heresy and theological endorsement of a Frankish invasion of Languedoc during the Albigensian Crusade. \\n Papal economic support for the restoration of the Medici as masters of Florence. \\n Papal negotiations with Francis I of France and Charles V of the HRE over the suzerainty of Naples (i.e. negotiating the foreign policy status of an outside polity with two third parties) \\n Sources:  Peter H.

By all means, if you're heart is set in living in those places, go apply there. University of Colorado-Boulder (not the other campuses) is good, as are ASU and Univ of Arizona (I think they're strong in Native American history, but I'm not sure). Montana State is ok. \\n One down side is that schools tend to be on the smaller side in terms of history department or departments in general. So if by chance you want to study one thing you find cool and no one teaches or knows anything about it, you're screwed. Or if you later develop a passion for cinema or dance or an obscure subfield of astrophysics, you may wind up having to transfer to another school to be able to major in that. This is not much of an issue if you go to a big school like NYU, Michigan, Illinois, etc. Visit a whole bunch of campuses, both in CA and over there and get a feel of the place. Talk to students, look through their course offerings. Take campus tours. \\n The other thing to keep in mind is graduate school. If you want to become a history professor, DO NOT go to a low-ranked school. Undergrad is ok, but the hard fact is that schools consciously or not prefer hiring graduates from prestigious grad programs and tend to ignore applications from ghetto programs. It's not without reason->fancy phd grad program attracts -> top professors who enjoy huge salaries, lots of support to write books -> attract the smartest grad students -> possibly future famous professors. This is not always true of course. The flipside is that you shouldnt go to Harvard or Yale for grad school unless there is someone there who you can work with (they probably wont admit you otherwise at any rate) What you should later do is identify who are the best professors in your field-whatever it ends up being-and go there. \\n Why does this all matter?

I believe that contemporary historians should, if anything, be more blatant about where they're coming from.

Back in the days of the Republic after the Punic Wars, Rome was over run with poor hungry citizens, many of them veterans, who had been bought out of their farms by rich business men. A pair of reformers, [the Gracchi Brothers]( pushed for a lot of reforms to help alleviate the situation of Rome's poor including land reform and subsidized grain prices. \\n Both men were killed for their trouble but the state continued to sell some of the grain that it had collected as taxes at a reduced rate. The problem wasn't solved and in the price of grain continued to rise, especially after slave revolts on Sicily interrupted production. \\n Fast forward to the final days of the Roman Republic. [Clodius Pulcher]( one of the most intersting men from that time period, was elected tribune of the plebs by promising free grain. The expense was enormous but the powerful men of Rome were preoccupied with Julius Caesar and the coming civil war so the grain dole stood. \\n Rome entered a period of civil war for the next 22 or so years before Augustus finally emerged as emperor. By that time the grain dole was so firmly entrenched in pubic policy that Augustus decided that abolishing it would lead to civil war, though he did try to minimize the size of the dole. \\n Conclusion/ TL;DR:  Did the grain dole lead to the collapse of the empire? Hardly, the grain dole first appeared just before Rome became an empire and before Rome reached it's greatest extent under Trajan. In the long run it may have drained the treasury and caused problems for the state, but it's pretty difficult to make a convincing argument that it was THE biggest factor leading to the fall of Rome. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"There was free grain (in the city of Rome not throughout the empire) even trouble with free grain near the end of Western Rome, but it didn't cause the fall.

When the empire was weak supplying the grain became an additional challenge. More people needed it and instability meant that more people had to be appeased too. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"Actually, a case could be made that the decline and eventual collapse of the Qing was partly attributable to a policy instituted by the Qianlong Emperor (reigned 1735-1796) never to raise taxes above the level established by his grandfather Kangxi (reigned 1661-1722) (in fact, Qianlong actually cut taxes). Although the first part of the eighteenth century was something close to a golden age of prosperity for China, things grew worse and worse in the second half, in part because Qianlong was convinced that Kangxi's successful policies did not need to be adapted to fit changing circumstances. The population grew, but the state and bureaucracy did not have the resources to expand with it, leading to corruption, inefficiency, and lack of justice for ordinary people, plus the growth of secret societies and widespread revolts.

This situation arose at least since the Investiture Conflict and intensified very quickly, as traditionally the emperor was a - well, something akin to a - German, at least, after Frederick II (he was King of Sicily through inheriting the crown from the family of his mother and spend most of his life in South Italy). So, we have this situation: an emperor, who constantly has to fight his own higher aristocracy and who\\'s most of the time far, far away, trying to be the overlord of Italy. Some of the Italians helped the emperor - mostly when they could gain something through it; legitimacy, sometimes help against their enemies - some not. So, over time, the Italians found out that the guy up in the North wasn\\'t as powerful as he said he was, so they simply stopped to acknowlede him as their overlord. Being weak in Germany, most of the emperors couldn\\'t do anything about this - some tried, most of them ultimatively failed. \\n Except Maximilian and Charles V [this phase being after 1490 to about 1550]. They lead a few wars against France - France wanted to have Neaples (which was never a part of the Reich) and was allied to a few states in Northern Italy (Macchiavelli, yes, that one, has a lot of things to say about that). The emperors mostly won. They came to have more influence in Italy again. And now comes the tricky part. Charles V. left his giant realm to his brother Ferdinand - who would be emperor - and his son Phillipp - who would be King of Spain. Phillip got most of the Italian parts. Following that, the Habsburgs in Spain and the Habsburgs in Austria got some essential problems in their own countries, which allowed Italy to become relatively independent again. Savoy, for example, was, until it was made a kingdom, a member of the imperial diet - the Reichstag. The other North Italian states not, but were considered part of the Reich. The emperor still was called King of Italy until 1648 - that\\'s why it\\'s not on the map in the article. But that\\'s a bit misleading, since they - more or less - were still considered a part of the HRE until the end of the HRE. More or less means that there was a lot of dynamics in that. The Habsburgs sometime lost some parts, but  succeded in getting great parts until Napoleon conquered it. To be frank, the legal status of Italy was confusing even to the jurists of the HRE. \\n TL;DR. Italy had never really accepted to be ruled by the emperor, so he was most of the times just de jure ruler. The situation on the map comes from the emperor after 1648 not being \"King of Italy\" anymore. De jure, the Italian states were still vassals of the Reich. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Surprisingly as it might seem to us, carrier pigeons were actually pretty awesome. I\\'m going to use a relatively modern example, because it\\'s one of the best documented uses of carrier pigeons EVER. \\n Okay, so it\\'s World War I. Right now you\\'re thinking \"They used carrier pigeons in WWI??\" and the answer is YES because it was a tried-and-true form of communication. They had telephones, but the telephone lines they laid down were easily cut or intercepted, mostly because the wires were rather fragile. Radios had a limited range and were very bulky and also fragile. Smoke signals and communications flags were also used. However, EVERY combatant army in WWI used carrier pigeons, as they were a relatively fast and reliable form of communication when lines were broken. \\n One example I\\'ll be using to highlight how awesome these birds were is that of the \"Lost Battalion.\" One battalion (about 550 men, nine companies of the 77th Division) went \"Over the top,\" their flanks being secured on one flank by Americans and on the other by the French. Well, the French were pushed back, and the Americans on the other flank fell back because the French fell back. Unfortunately, this battalion didn\\'t get the message. They kept advancing so they could meet their ojectives, having been given a \"No Retreat\" order. They advanced straight into the Argonne Forest. They came up to a hill known only as \"Hill 198,\" which had a double line of entrenched German soldiers. Because they were a pretty badass group of guys, they broke through the German lines, occupying the hill for themselves. At this point, they still believed that the French were on their right and the Americans were on their left. Well, until that night when they were able to send out scouts - and they found that they were  completely encircled by the Germans.  Their telephone wire had (obviously) been cut, so no comms were going out that way. However, they still had their carrier pigeons with them. The next afternoon, the Germans attacked from all sides, however, the Americans were able to fight them off. The Americans sent off a few carrier pigeons relaying their desperate position, however, it wasn\\'t clear to them whether or not any of them actually made it through. \\n The next day, October 4th, was their worst day. We\\'re not sure whether the American commander (Whittlesley) wrote down the wrong coordinates, or whether the artillery was wrong. Either way, at least one of the pigeons got through the Germans (There was no doubt about them making it to their destination) and told the artillery to help out. Well, what commenced was a REALLY painful incident to read about - it was friendly fire 101. The artillery was firing right on the American positions, and the Germans figured it was a great time to attack. The Americans only had three carrier pigeons left. The pigeon carrying the first message (\"Many wounded. We cannot evacuate.\") was shot down. A second bird was sent with the message, \"Men are suffering. Can support be sent?\" That pigeon also was shot down. Only one homing pigeon was left: \"[Cher Ami]( She was dispatched with a note in a canister on her left leg, \\n > WE ARE ALONG THE ROAD PARALLEL 276.4. OUR ARTILLERY IS DROPPING A BARRAGE DIRECTLY ON US. FOR HEAVENS SAKE STOP IT. \\n As Cher Ami tried to fly back home, the Germans saw her rising out of the brush and opened fire. For several moments, Cher Ami flew with bullets zipping through the air all around her. Cher Ami was eventually shot down but managed to take flight again. She arrived back at her loft at division headquarters 25 miles to the rear in just 65 minutes, helping to save the lives of the 194 survivors. In this last mission, Cher Ami delivered the message despite having been shot through the breast, blinded in one eye, covered in blood and with a leg hanging only by a tendon. \\n (I actually quoted that straight from Wikipedia, because it has the best succinct description of that badass bird.) \\n Needless to say, the Lost Battalion created a pocket that the Germans weren\\'t able to break, heavily contributing to their retreat from the Western Front.

Usually they were color instruments to contrast with guitars. Johnny Johnson of Chuck Berry\\'s original band is a good example. Having a piano really limits a touring band as well. Any venue would be required to have their own piano which cuts the number of venues significantly. \\n In the late 60\\'s Fender introduced the Rhodes, which used amplified metal bars instead of strings (which can\\'t hold tuning while traveling) and while it was still heavy, it wasn\\'t as bad as a real piano and could actually tour. That, along with accelerated developments in electronic keyboards in the early 70s led to the rise of the prog-rock bands like Yes and Emerson, Lake & Palmer, which allowed the keyboardist to become an equal to the guitarist for a period of time. \\n At the same time there came Elton John who generally stuck with the piano but followed in the footsteps of flamboyant rockers like Jerry Lee Lewis. While he was able to rock out on a great show fronting from a piano (and I know first hand, I saw him five times in the 70s and early 80s), it was still an instrument that limited the performer. So in the 80s someone developed the most awkward instrument ever - that oddball hybrid of an electronic keyboard with a stalk sticking out on the end that contained a \"pitxh bending wheel,\" a little button like the scrolling button on a computer mouse that allowed the performer to bend the pitch the same way a guitarist can do it by bending the string. Potentially the keyboardist could emulate the guitarist in position and showmanship. The problem was that guitarists grow up bending strings and it\\'s a natural element of their instrument, which is not the case with pianists. \\n So it never sounded right and worse yet it looked weird. Pianists grow up sitting at their keyboard and generally look awkward as hell trying to move around at the front of the stage playing this bizarre looking keyboard. The instrument added nothing intrinsically new to the sound so everyone watching knew what was really going on - the keyboard player just wants to be at the same level as the guitarist and strut his rock star moves out front, and since he generally wasn\\'t good at it, it was kind of pathetic.

Ireland is made up of 32 counties within the four historical Provinces (Ulster in the North, Leinster in the East, Munster in the South, Connacht in the West). Ulster is comprised of 9 counties, 6 of which were separated into Northern Ireland. \\n Industrial Ulster:  The biggest reason for the ultimate divide was the industrial significance of the North.  During the nineteenth century Ulster, and in particular Belfast in Country Antrim, grew in both population and industrial output. In 1800 the population of Belfast was roughly 20,000 but grew more than ten times to 230,000 by 1880.  During this same period Dublin merely doubled in population.  Primarily, this was due to the development of the linen industry, different from the wool industry of the South.  There are a variety of reasons for the success of linen, none of which are significant to the question at hand (such as tenant rights, British suppression of the wool industry during the seventeenth century).  A few other key developments included the short growth of the cotton industry between 1800-1820, which brought in a large number of Protestant immigrants, and the cotton shortage caused by the American Civil War.  The cotton shortage pushed Ulster linen to the top of the market due to it's ready availability.  However, the most significant industrial development was the growth of the Belfast shipbuilding industry.  In 1853 Edward Harland took over as manager of a shipyard on Queens Island, and through his engineering improvements and business acumen was able to spearhead the local industry.  All of these developments turned Belfast and the rest of the Protestant North into not just the industrial center of Ireland but one of the key industrial centers of Britain.* \\n Division:  With the background out of the way we can quickly get into why the six counties were chosen as the points of division.  You asked if it was always assumed that the North would be split and the answer is basically Yes.  With the development of the North and the political growth of Nationalism throughout Ireland, the possibility of Home Rule (essentially an Ireland politically free from Britain) became almost inevitable.  Protestants in the North feared that a free Ireland would result in the economic collapse of the North and the political suppression of Protestants by the dominant Catholic majority.  Leading up to the Third Home Rule Bill of 1914, Unionists led by Edward Carson began to organize the Ulster Volunteers into a militia served with standing against Ulster being separated from Britain.  The 1914 Bill passed after a compromise that would see the North temporarily separated, though the details were not finalized as the Bill had to be shelved with the outbreak of World War I.  Starting in 1916, the Anglo-Irish War was waged until a truce the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in December 1921.  The Treaty established both Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State.  With the Treaty dividing the country, the Northern Six counties were chosen to serve as the most reasonable Unionist counties: this wasn't entirely accurate as Tyrone and Fermanagh had Nationalist majorities. \\n The Boundary Commission:  Established by the Irish Free State Treaty of 1921, the Commission was to be made up of representatives from both Parliaments of Ireland (the North and the South) under a British chairman.  The Commission was actually an appeasement offered to Nationalists that were opposed to dividing Ireland.  Nationalists assumed that the two counties of Tyrone and Fermanagh, along with the city of Derry, would be given to the Free State due to their Nationalist majorities; however, due to the internal politics of the Commission and the possibility that carving up the North in such a way would make it politically unviable (as Nationalists hoped), the Commission left the border unchanged.  Despite the unpopularity of this decision, \\n>the Free State government had no option but to sign an agreement...whereby the border stayed as it was.  The Free State was freed from making various contributions to the United Kingdom's public debt and the payment of pensions to former members of the Royal Irish Constabulary.* \\n The Commission was a political tool that pacified Nationalists and Unionists in the North for enough time that each State's governments were able to establish themselves.  There was little chance that it would have ever properly altered the border but it gave hope to the pro-Irish Nationalists. \\n TL/DR:  The border was drawn up by dividing the Unionist counties, which were positioned in the North, from the Nationalist counties. Northern Ireland was the industrial powerhouse of Ireland, an essential region for the British economy that had a majority population of Protestants that predominately sought to remain within the British Union. \\n \\n \\n Robert Kee,  The Green Flag: A History of Irish Nationalism  (London: Penguin Books, 1972), 394-395. \\n Tim Pat Coogan,  The IRA  (New York: Palgrave, 2002), 53. \\n \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"There are two main reasons why a war with Russia was desirable at the time. Firstly, the war in the west was all but over. France was defeated and only Britain held out. This meant that Hitler was free to turn his attentions elsewhere as Britain could be finished off later. Secondly, the USA weren't in the war. As studies of Hitler's Ideology indicate, the Lebensraum principle really meant that Hitler didn't want all that much of Russia to use for his own devices. As such, a quick winnable war with Russia before the USA were provoked into joining the war was extremely desirable as it would mean that Germany could fight on one front at a time. \\n Was this a realistic prospect? At the start, the Soviet army was awful. The conduct of their war against Finland was exceptionally poor and they struggled to overcome that foe. The first few months of Operation Barbarossa showed this to be the case as well as the Germans rapidly progressed. \\n The failure of Operation Barbarossa, however, was down to three main reasons: \\n Firstly, Stalin was willing to sacrifice everything to not lose the war. Human costs were allowable. Hitler had underestimated that and expected the state to crumble as it had in World War One. When it didn't, it turned a quick winnable war into a very difficult one. \\n Secondly and Thirdly are both down to the question of supplies. The issue for any country invading Russia is that it is a very big place and keeping supply lines is extremely difficult. However, the speed of the initial German advance threatened to make this issue irrelevant. It presented Hitler with a crossroads: He could have chosen to go for Moscow, capture the auspices of the Russian state that remained there and cut the head of the Bolsheviks off, more or less forcing Stalin to try and recover the west from the Crimea or behind the Urals. The other option was, of course, what he chose which was to divert the attack on Moscow into trying to secure the Crimea and the oil there. While they were able to do that, by the time they could turn their attentions back on Moscow, the Russians had gotten organised and the weather had turned meaning that the Germans were left static. This meant that the Russians were able to reinforce, break the weakened centre of the Nazi thrust towards Moscow and turn them back. \\n TL;DR - The Germans prepared for and needed a quick war. Strategic errors meant they didn't get it \\n\",\n  0),\n ('Oh boy! This is awesome. I actually went to Cuba over the summer so I think I can help you out here. \\n One of the destinations I made sure to visit was the Morro Cabana military park. They have a sort of memorial to the Cuban missile crisis there. I unfortunately did not take any pictures of the plaques, but I will try to convey the overall message of the park to you as best as I can. I realize that this is not ideal for you but it is the best I can do. I found a couple pictures of the park online (they aren\\'t my pictures), so that may also help you visualize the park. \\n The first thing you need to know is that in Cuba there is no such thing as the  Cuban missile crisis . If you ask a Cuban citizen what it was like during the Cuban missile crisis they are going to look at you quizzically and ask, \"what is that?\". In Cuba it is called the  Crisis de octubre , which literally means the crisis of October. \\n While they still call it a crisis, it is for a different reason. You need to understand that  The Revolution  strongly believed the United States to be the biggest threat to Cuban sovereignty. There are numerous documents (cuban-american treaty, platt ammendment, etc) that prove the United States has more than just a neighborly interest in the island. However, the most damning evidence of U.S. aggression is the failed Bay of Pigs invasion which took place in April of 1961; just a year and half before the Cuban missile crisis in October of 1962. The Bay of Pigs invasion was still fresh in the minds of the Cuban people. \\n The reason they call it a crisis is because it was the absolute closest the United States has ever come to starting a full blown war against Cuba since the revolution took control of the government. For the Cuba, having nuclear missiles was no crisis. The crisis was that the United States was trying to control Cuba with military might. The Cubans saw the naval blockade as North American aggression designed to impede Cuba\\'s ascent to sovereignty. The United States was flat out telling Cuba that they couldn\\'t have nuclear missiles, but that the U.S. could. That didn\\'t sit well with Cuba. They believed that they had the same right as the U.S. to possess nuclear missiles. \\n The most heated moment of the whole event was when the USAF U2 spy plane piloted by Rudolf Anderson was shot down in Cuba. Kennedy\\'s levelheadedness during this event is the only reason the world exists today. Nearly every General at his disposal said that they would launch an attack at the first sign of aggression by Cuban forces, with or without the support of the Commander in Chief. Luckily, word of the downed aircraft didn\\'t get to the Generals until long after the Crisis was over. The [wing of the plane]( now sits at Morro Cabana, open to the elements and not guarded at all. You can literally have a sit down on the wing of the plane that almost ended the world. In the background of the photo you can see replicas of the nuclear arms that were once stationed in Cuba. They also have a couple [anti-aircraft guns]( and [a plane]( set up there. No idea if those are the AA guns that shot down the U2, they\\'re just the ones on display. \\n The U2 spy plane being shot down was (and is) considered a victory by the Revolution. It asserted Cuba\\'s sovereign right to protect it\\'s airspace from invasion. It also showed Cuba\\'s \"restraint\" with nuclear arms. They believe the fact that they didn\\'t fire any of their Luna or Sopka short range missiles (local commander was authorized to fire without extra permission in the event of an invasion) while the U.S. blockaded and flew planes over them (considered an act of war) proved that they were responsible enough to possess nuclear arms. \\n Even though they were disarmed by the Soviets, Cuba still considered it a victory when the U.S. pledged to never invade Cuba again, and to withdraw their nuclear missiles from Turkey. \\n If you want to learn more, I would suggest reading some of Che / Fidel\\'s speeches. They don\\'t even necessarily have to be about the Cuban missile crisis, because the message remains consistent every time they speak publicly. They truly believed in the revolution and Cuban exceptionalism. They didn\\'t want to be pushed around and used any more. \\n tl;dr: United States is trying to bully Cuba by hypocritically telling them that they couldn\\'t have nuclear missiles. Cuba sees itself as responsible by showing restraint and only shooting at the planes that flew into their airspace to spy on them. Even though Cuba ultimately is disarmed of nuclear missiles, it sees the event as a victory because the U.S. publicly pledges not to invade Cuba ever again, and the United States removes its missiles from Turkey.

To give you an example from my own subfield: Regarding the Oracle Bones inscriptions which you may be familiar with, there's no certainty that the language they are encoding is the ancestor to modern Sinitic languages. In fact it's well accepted in academia that multiple dialects if not languages were being written in the Oracle Bone inscriptions. So just the point that they're the earliest written form of Chinese isn't really an objectively meaningful claim. \\n The reason that the cultural claim is justifiable is that it's in the framework of  heritage  and political continuance; One dynasty falls and the next to succeed is the rightful heir to political legitimacy. Thus the 5000 years of unbroken continuous civilisation. Looking at shifting political borders is only going to complicate things, and isn't going to find you any peace. \\n But again this argument of 5000 years of history which you're reminded about every time you see the TVs on public transport or any time you flip on CCTV9 are not objective historical claims. The argument of heritage is not one that can be made for the United States, for example. The US is 238 years old, regardless of Greek heritage in government, or Europeans living in North America a hundred+ years before 1776. \\n Comparing to other historical precedents elsewhere won't get you anywhere. \\n tl;dr:  It's not history. It's nationalism. \\n \\n edit:  Something that might be useful outside the context of arguing with your neighbours is to keep in mind that there is China that is the People's Republic of China 中华人民共和国 a.k.a. 中国, and there is China which is Taiwan that is officially the Republic of China 中华民国, and there is China as in the geographical region which in Chinese can be called  Zhonghua  中华 and is independent of modern political boundaries.  Zhonghua  is China as a region in the sense that the Indian subcontinent is a region or Western Europe is a region. So if you're bothered by the issue, which you may well be the way most people tend to talk to foreigners about it here, you can always tell yourself that they mean  Zhonghua  中华 China and not  Zhongguo  中国 China. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"> I'm surprised no one has mentioned Canadian and American residential boarding schools' active roles in language death. \\n And punishment for peaking a stigmatized language -- or language variety -- is a pattern that has been repeated many times.

The traditional great powers of Europe? The Franco-Prussian War was an epoch-defining event that shook up the traditional order in central Europe, which allowed the Prussians and the North German Confederation to formally unite the southern German kingdoms of Württemberg, Baden, and Bavaria into a single, German state. Any balance-of-power equations that would have existed prior to 1871 about a fractious, disunified Germany, would have to have been re-evaluated. \\n An important aspect of why there was little fervor to really intervene on the side of France during the war was because of diplomatic maneuvering on the part of Prussian Chancellor Otto von Bismarck to diplomatically isolate France by the time the war broke out in 1870, and his diplomatic baiting with the  Ems Dispatch , and the disastrous [Battle of Sedan]( which saw the capture and surrender of 120,000 French troops and the capture of their leader, Napoleon III. \\n Because of France\\'s prior actions in the 1860s under Napoleon III\\'s foreign policy, they alienated the Austrians by aiding the Italians in their [Second War of Independence (1859)]( which saw the Austrians lose territory to the nascent and newly-unified Italians. Bismarck\\'s diplomatic maneuvering kept Russia nominally friendly or at the very least neutral against Prussia when they went to [war with Austria in 1866]( which culminated in Austria\\'s loss of influence with the other German minor states, opening up the path to unification under the \"Little Germany\" unification idea, which was Germany without Austria. \\n France\\'s foreign policy also alienated Britain, in that their colonial conquests and foreign policy tended to be anti-Britannic, which was the traditional mode of thought for Franco-Briton enmity at the time, and has existed for centuries up until that point. After Prussia\\'s victories in 1866, and Bismarck\\'s vague promises of compensating Napoleon III for guaranteeing French neutrality while the Prussians curbstomped the Austrians, France saw itself somewhat swindled by the current state of affairs in the period between 1866-1870 - suddenly, to their east, was a large country that was more politically unified than ever before, and worse, had a professional military with reserves that they can mobilize that can outnumber their men in the field. \\n Compound this strategic reversal on the map of Europe was the fact that France had very little to count on from the other European powers: \\n \\n Britain was cold towards France as was the usual case. France was seen as the \"biggest threat\" to Britain, and despite their cooperation against Russia in the Crimean War, there were a series of naval arms races between the two countries that made relations cold. \\n \\n Russia was not friendly towards France because of the latter\\'s involvement in the Crimean War, easily within living memory of the statesmen of the time, not to mention Napoleon III was seen as one of the arch-architects of organizers of the coalition against Russia during that war. \\n \\n Austria certainly could not be counted on due to their recent reorganization in having to make [political concessions to their Hungarian counterparts]( after the disastrous war of 1866 left the Austrians militarily and politically impotent during the 1870 war. \\n \\n The United States was not going to be involved, they just emerged from their Civil War in 1865, and not to mention they were not in any power to mount any kind of military expedition in the aid of France. \\n \\n Italy might have been the only state that could have helped France, but they were also recently unified and consolidating. However, France was still guaranteeing the security of the Pope in Rome, and Italian nationalists yearned to make Rome their capital. When the war broke out, the French withdrew their Roman garrison to reinforce the mainland, and the Italians promptly occupied Rome. However, there were Italians who did not forget France\\'s part in aiding the Italian unification efforts of 1850-1860s, and there were those who joined on the side of France during the war, such as the Italian patriot Giuseppe Garibaldi, who led a [volunteer force]( to aid the French. \\n \\n Spain did what it did best in the Nineteenth Century - which was to stay neutral of Continental European affairs in a large part. \\n \\n \\n The Prussians understood that the war had to be kept short and the overall strategic objective was to secure German unification, and that meant defeating France, whose interests were not served by a strong, unified Germany, which would replace France as the pre-eminent European land power. Bismarck himself even said he did not want Germany to annex the French provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, judging (correctly) that this would lead to a permanent enmity with France, but the German nationalists and German military leaders won that debate in arguing that Alsace-Lorraine was populated by ethnic Germans, and the military leaders arguing that they wanted a strategic buffer on their western frontier controlled directly by the central government in Berlin. This enmity between France and Germany would be one of the culminating causes of World War One, and Bismarck\\'s diplomatic policies of keeping France diplomatically isolated ended with his dismissal in 1890, with Kaiser Wilhelm II\\'s \"zig-zag\" foreign policy achieving relative diplomatic isolation on the part of Germany when [France and Russia formally concluded a military alliance in 1892]( thus surrounding Germany with potentially hostile powers on two fronts - something Bismarck feared the most, and had come to pass. \\n TLDR; brilliant diplomatic maneuvering on the part of Bismarck and alienating French foreign policy by Napoleon III in the years leading up the the 1870 war left the French diplomatically isolated and effectively gave the Prussians a free hand in defeating the French. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"I can't speak to the Brandenbergs, but the Habsburgs are my area of expertise. \\n The Habsburg rulers, though gaining their power relatively late in the game, were able to utilize a mythos which linked them to the old Roman emperors.

Canada and the other dominions (Australia, New Zealand, etc.) had been granted independence in foreign affairs by the Statute of Westminster in 1931.  That being said, Canada had yet to assert their autonomy in a meaningful way by 1956. Though much is made of the fact that Canada declared war on Germany independently of Britain in 1939, our somewhat delayed declaration was really a foregone conclusion.  If Britain went to war, we would go to war to defend our closest ally. \\n Thus, the Suez Crisis constituted a genuine shift in Canadian foreign policy.  For the first time, Canada made it explicitly clear that they would not be backing Britain in their latest adventure. The days of \"Ready, aye, ready\" were long gone. Israel had already invaded Egypt in October 1956, and in November Britain and France landed troops along the Suez Canal.  However, when the Soviet Union threatened the the UK and France with nuclear war if they intervened, it was clear that something had to be done. Before the fighting got out of hand, Canadian External Affairs Minister Lester B. Pearson suggested that a United Nations force be sent to the region to separate the two sides and implement a cease fire.  The creation of the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) was unique at the time, and Pearson was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1957. \\n The Suez Crisis was an important demonstration of Canadian autonomy, and could be regarded as a maturation of Canada\\'s role as a middle power in international diplomacy. \\n 2) Identity \\n Canadians have been known to regularly cite peacekeeping as one of our enduring contributions to the international stage.  It is a point of pride for many Canadians that Canada is known around the world as the founders of peacekeeping, as well as one of the greatest contributors to peacekeeping missions over the years.  The idea of Canada as a nation of peacekeepers, an \"honest broker\", a middle power, etc. has become so ingrained in the national consciousness that some historians are now challenging what they call the \"peacekeeping myth\".  Eric Wagner breaks down how Canadian peacekeeping missions were based on strategic rather than moral foundations in the \"The Peaceable Kingdom?\".  The argument is that missions such as Cyprus were more about defending the interests of NATO - in that particular case preventing a conflict between two NATO countries, Turkey and Greece - than they were about moral indignation. \\n It is worth noting that, like almost all expressions of Canadian nationalism, the emphasis on peacekeeping is as much about differentiating Canada from the United States as it is about taking pride in Canadian contributions. \\n TL;DR:  Yes, it was an important step for Canadian autonomy.

Many people simply assumed that it was just a really big bomb.\" This is absolutely true. The United States military and government really didn\\'t know what they had created - fallout and its medical effects were very poorly understood. \\n To give a graphic and striking example, in 1946 the American military began conducting above ground nuclear tests in the Marshall Islands. For the first test, they \"permanently evacuated\" the population of an island called Bikini Atoll. In the islands lagoon they placed 95 vessels, including decommissioned aircraft carriers and captured German and Japanese ships. Researchers strapped live animals - goats, pigs, rats, and sheep - to the boats, to act as live test subjects. A few hours after two nuclear bombs were dropped on the ships, 15,000 American soldiers were sent to Bikini\\'s lagoon to survey the damage and to  decontaminate the ships by hand-scrubbing them with Tide.  There are photographs of U.S. government workers scrubbing themselves with Tide detergent to clean off the radiation. \\n Tide. The United States government obviously didn\\'t have the slightest fucking idea what they were dealing with. \\n As a side-note: even after the government came to understand radiation and its dangers better, the military and the Atomic Energy Commission continued to lie and mislead Americans effected by testing. In the 1950s, the United States continued exposing US soldiers and civilians to fallout in their Nevada testing range, often marching soldiers into contaminated areas to do drills and see how well they would stand up under radiation sickness. When downwind civilians from Arizona, Nevada, and Utah complained of cancer and mutations effecting humans and animals, the government dismissed their claims. Many Americans were outright lied to about the dangers of nuclear testing. Women who complained about radiation burns and losing their hair were told that they suffered from neurosis. The reason I add all of this, is because there is definitely a serious degree of guilt and culpability about how the government mishandled its nuclear testing programs, and the human damage they caused, and I don\\'t want my anecdote above to give the impression that the Federal government did it all by accident, which is, of course, what they claim. \\n Source: \"Bravo for the Marshallese: Regaining Control in a Post-Nuclear, Post-Colonial World\" by Holly Barker - a devastating and short book that I highly recommend to anyone interested in the American nuclear testing program in the pacific. \\n TL;DR the US government didn\\'t understand radiation; tried to decontaminate American soldiers exposed to fallout using Tide Laundry Detergent. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Well now,  grossly  out of context?  Mea Culpa brother, but don\\'t blame me... blame Shelby Foote. \\n But in the end we are saying the same thing.  Meaning, if your claim is true: \\n >Had McClellan shown the slightest bit of aggressiveness and \\n >deployed his reserves the Confederate army would have been \\n >annihilated. Thomas Jackson knew this and being the religious man he \\n >was, attributed the army\\'s survival to God\\'s mercy. \\n That still makes Jackson a bad general.  If Jesus had to save you in a fight where you were certain to lose, and Jackson was willing to sacrifice all of his men in that battle, and was razor close to actually doing so, that makes him an idiot.  He should not have been thanking God, he should have thanked McClellan\\'s weak backbone. \\n \"Thank God my opponents are incompetent, or else I would look really stupid,\" Does not make a great general.  I can just picture him in his head thinking, \\'no big deal; it is not like we have a significant limited resource problem.\\' \\n Riddle me this, if Lee had been in McClellan\\'s place (as Lincoln had asked), and Jackson in Lee\\'s place, how long do you think the Confederacy would have fared?  Be honest?  Not long at all.  Jackson wasn\\'t great, he was just outside of the weight class of early northern commanders.  This would ware off as leadership in the north adapted for victory. \\n In any case, what I mean by Jackson conceptualizing total war is exactly what I said.  March men fast and fight them hard, harder than your opponent.  Resupply off the land if need be, keep the campaign going, take the textbook tactical position and don\\'t give it up because of carnage.  These were not paradigms shared by most sane people at the time, no less wimpy northern command. \\n 15+ miles a day is impressive, but keep in mind that Sherman\\'s march to the sea was 10+ miles a day, and they had less resupply and reeked far more destruction.  The lesson learned from Jackson and subsequent Southern leaders was: these people are willing to sacrifice a irresponsibly large amount... oblige them quickly. \\n Jackson isn\\'t total war.  Jackson is escalation.  McClellan was a tiptoe general, if the southerners had been the same, the war would not have been near as costly.  But the end result probably would have been the same. \\n To address a lower comment, Jackson at Gettysburg means a Confederate independence?  Doubtful, just because the Northern victory would not have been as crushing, doesn\\'t mean that the anaconda plan would not have still resulted in ultimate surrender. \\n tl;dr If northern generals were not so bashful Jackson probably would have died well before \\'63. \\n',\n  0),\n ('From what I have read on this thread so far, it seems that people have a tendency to think of Rommel as romanticized and Jackson as appropriately revered. \\n I am going to take the devils advocate approach here.  Because I personally think that Jackson is at least equally over romanticized, if not more in the US. \\n On the onset of The American Civil War, Jackson was a fighter up against a Union leadership bench mostly populated with bureaucrats who were not prepared for a total war.  Keep in mind, a victory for the Confederacy during The Civil War was gaining Union recognition as an independent nation (it is really only called the Civil War because the south lost, if they won it would probably be called The Confederate Revolutionary War.)  On the other side of that same coin, a victory as viewed by early union military leadership was anything resulting in restoration of the union, which many of them thought was inevitable (it was), at minimal cost of union lives. \\n However as a result of this attitude by Union military leadership, Jackson distinguishes himself as a fearless brawler and proficient tactician.  What I mean by this is, textbook wise, Jackson was probably no more brilliant than any of his northern opponents. He simply enforced meticulous discipline (which is the sound choice if you want to win at ANYTHING) chose sound tactics for the weaponry available, and did not change them in the face of carnage, even to the point of blatant disregard for the well being of his men. \\n To illustrate the point: \\n In April 1862 Confederate congress approved [pikes for 20 brigades be made for deployment in battle.](  To his credit, he had the foresight to know early on that if you weren\\'t comfortable with bayonet combat you were going to have a bad time, but to his detriment, almost every celebrated officer also figured this out. \\n Upon surveying the dead at Antietam, a battle at which confederate forces lost over a quarter of their men, Jackson said, [\"God has been very kind to us this day.\"](  I am not trying to take this out of context, but illustrate that he probably believed that if they fought hard enough The Confederacy would gain its independence, or at least, autonomy and slavery rights.  In addition to being hip to the idea of bayonet tactics early, he also conceptualized and even forced reluctant northern generals into a total war early.  He knew they didn\\'t want that, and hoped it would demoralize them into giving up.  This tactic ended up backfiring and costing the South very dearly later in the war. \\n I mean just look up a page of quotes from the guy, he said crazy things, like when you go to war take out your sword and throw away the scabbard (paraphrased).  Clearly he thought that the fierceness would win the war for the South.  Which would be brilliant, except that it would only win them escalation to total war that would take decades to recover from. \\n These tactics were great, until the North found itself some leaders who were comfortable with the same tactics, which while commendable were not spectacularly complicated.  My argument is that even if Jackson had not died in 1863, he would have still been beaten by Grant, Sherman and generally overwhelming Northern advantages. \\n Edit: I realize that I am oversimplifying by calling these tactics, and there were a whole host of tactics that a commander needed to know to wage successful battle, for which Jackson was also proficient, again, I contest that while he knew these and could execute, what made him superior at first was he lengths at which he was willing to go with them to outmatch unenthusiastic adversaries. \\n Jackson died in 1863.  The Northern drunks (Grant and Sherman) didn\\'t come to substantial power until around or after his death, and I think it wouldn\\'t have taken long for Jackson to be defeated. \\n He is over romanticized for being on the losing team, being a larger than life figure in discipline and speech, and for perishing before he had a chance to be truly defeated. \\n tl;dr He gets Kurt Cobain love from historians for being an average commander pulling out early wins against northern bureaucrats who were not ready to stomach total war. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"It could have been worse; the actual Persians had 22 ft. ogres, not 18 ft. ones like in the movie. \\n tl;dr: don't watch 300 for historical value. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"While /u/MrMarbles2000 is correct, I would argue that there are deeper seeds of hatred against Napoleon. \\n Britain \\nFirst, Britain was the long enemy of Napoleon. Napoleon hated Britain with a passion and wanted to see it burn. However, Britain wanted to keep the order of Continental Europe to it's pre-war order. The main political goal of Britain was to ensure that no single European power that could dominate the Continental Economy. So, Britain wanted to stop Napoleon because of the economic power that he was becoming. \\n Austria \\nThe Holy Roman Empire was dissolved as a result of the defeat of Austria and Russia during the famous 1805 campaign that ended at Austerlitz. So, from the beginning, the Austrians wanted to ruin Napoleon because they ruined the great title they had. With the exception of armies commanded by Archduke Charles, Napoleon humiliated every Austrian army that was pulled out until 1813. Even then, Napoleon easily defeated Austrian armies in 1814. For Austria, it's a matter of pride, they were constantly defeated but kept on coming. There is more, mainly in respect to how the Habsburgs wanted revenge for the movement that killed Marie Antoinette, but that is mainly their anger during the Revolution. \\n Prussia \\nNow, Prussia was THE military power until the French Revolution when they got humiliated as well but not as bad as Austria. The big humiliation came at the double battle of Jena-Auserstedt, where Napoleon faced one half of the Prussian army with near equal numbers while Louis Davout humiliated the flower of Prussian honor while almost outnumbered three to one. Afterward, Napoleon implemented the Continental System which economically ruined Prussia. From there, Queen Louise helped pushed the weak willed Frederick Wilhelm III to declaring war on Napoleon in 1813. From there, the Napoleonic Wars got a nationalistic flavor in Germany as they became the War of (German Liberation). This would pay off in the long run in terms of German identity. \\n Russia \\nThe First Patriotic War, as it is known in Russian historiography, should give you an idea as to why Russia hated Napoleon, but this is easily the trickiest explanation. \\n With the exception of the Treaty of Tilst in 1807, Russia was in a state of near constant war with France since the Revolution. However, the Russian fought and were consistently defeated but there wasn't any real hatred. In fact, Tsar Alexander and Napoleon were very good friends for a while but as the British flooded Russia with money and goods (while Russia ignored the Continental System) while Alexander's more militant advisers pushed for war. And here's the odd part, Alexander turned against Napoleon, almost convinced that Napoleon was the anti-Christ (Alexander was raised religiously). So, the war with Napoleon took a religious tone for Alexander personally but it became patriotic as Napoleon invaded Russian soil. The least hate would be from Russia. \\n Spain & Portugal \\nThis is weirdest of them all. Spain didn't hate Napoleon until Napoleon swept aside the Bourbon King. When Joseph mishandled Spain, it erupted into revolt against the French forces there that were trying to enforce the Continental System. It became almost religious, I even remember reading stories of priests becoming involved in the Spanish ulcer. However, the hate was warranted; the French looted and mistreated the locals (except the area commanded by Marshal Suchet). \\n The TL;DR is that Napoleon humiliated Europe in war and wanted revenge; except for Britain, they just wanted money. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"I would say Germany's suspicion that France wanted to invade were 100% founded. France was defeated by Germany in the Franco-Prussian war 40 years earlier, and France was utterly humiliated. Otto Von Bismarck new this was a mistake, and tried to urge his Generals to go 'easier' and France and relent. However this was to no avail. Therefore Bismarck set up the Alliance system with the understanding that France would inevitably try and invade. \\n However - the alliance system pretty much relied on Germany having a good alliance with Russia. Of-which they were originally on good terms (and therefore not an existential threat) - However the ascension of Kaiser Wilhelm undid all this. He immediately alienated the Russians and forced them into a treaty with France. \\n To answer your question, it didn't really matter if Russia was an existential threat or not. As long as they were on bad terms Germany would have to fight a war on two fronts - because France would look for any reason to go to war with Germany. This is all Bismarck tried to avoid - he even famously quotes: 'The secret of politics? Make a good treaty with Russia.' \\n tl;dr: France was an existential threat - Russia wasn't, but that didn't matter because war with Russia would always mean war with France. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('IIRC, Hoffman was trained under Strasberg, who\\'s regarded as one of the \"Great Adapters.\" There\\'s a substantial difference in styles from those trained in the US under Strasberg, Spolin, Meisner, and Adler\\'s methods and those trained in Russia under Stanislavski directly or some of his immediate proteges. This story is also pointed to as a difference between what should possibly be called the \"Adapted Method\", and a more traditional version of \"Method\" acting. \\n Primarily, staying up for three days and other such things are things that American teachers would supposedly encourage (and I can only confirm from certain experiences*.) Ideally, Hoffman should have used an incident of emotional memory, or \"The Magic \\'as if\\'\", to physically recall what it feels like, as well as to help him prep the emotional tactics and behavioral verbage choices he used to behave as though he were entirely exhausted. Affectations of voice and mannerisms beyond that just come from practice and control. \\n Of course, when the thought, \"Dustin Hoffman should have...\" comes out of my head, I always wonder if the story is just an exaggerated or outright fictional anecdote designed to warn of the dangers of not using emotional memory, or \"The Magic \\'as if\\'\", I\\'ve heard it referred to as to create an emotional state. Similar to showing up to set drunk to play a drunk character. If an actor does that, it just makes them a risky liability on the set, and it makes filming more difficult. \\n *The certain experiences I mentioned earlier is that I have been in classes where American teachers have said that students should get laid to experience what sex is, they should get drunk at least once to know what it\\'s like, they should do drugs at least once, etc. This is, of course, a mix between professors and actors who are just teaching to make an extra buck. I\\'ve also had American teachers who have pointed out behavior such as this as potentially dangerous (and morally repellent, as well as religiously repellent), and that you can go about researching your roles in other manners than having to directly live the experience. A good example of this is that me being drunk is not necessarily the same as a character being drunk the way it\\'s written. (edit: as /u/faithle55 pointed out below, the source of this story is William Goldman, based on his recollection on set with Olivier and Hoffman.) \\n I\\'ve only had one Russian teacher, and she pointed towards the Hoffman story as a sign of the difference between American \"Adapted\" Method and a closer Russian Method, though she said that all methods now are adapted by their teachers since Stanislavski is dead.

There is no \"Method\" any more, and Hoffman learned an adapted method. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"> Those pamphlets were very noteworthy as when the Revolutionary War started, everyone including George Washington would still toast to the king's health before a meal or tea; \\n This is overstating the case rather strongly. Congress continually referred to themselves as loyal subjects of the king up until the spring of 1776, so there was definitely still a large element that wanted to be reunited or at the least to avoid open war. \\n It's rather different proposition to assume that everyone still toasted the king--keep in mind that in New England (Massachusetts especially), common people had driven out vestiges of royal authority long before the Declaration of Independence. In Massachusetts there weren't any royal officials left outside of Boston by the spring of 1775. In September of 1774 the town of Worcester went so far as to tell it's representative to the Provincial Congress to work towards independence and to regard the union between Britain and America to be null and void. \\n >Paine changed everyone's mind \\n Again, this is putting too much stock in Paine's work. Common Sense was published January 10, 1776. In April of 1776 the Pennsylvania Assembly repealed the 1775 resolution which stated that it's delegates should oppose any motion towards a separation between Britain and England. John Adams had been working towards independence almost from the beginning. \\n Also Common Sense was not quite as well received as the myth makes it. For example Henry Laurens expressed concern over many of it's ideas in a letter to John Laurens. \\n In my view, there were two major events which had more (or at the very least as much) of an impact as  Common Sense . \\n The first was news reaching the colonies that King George III had hired foreign mercenaries to put down the rebellion and that they would treat Americans as a foreign enemy. This sent shock waves through Americans (and even many Englishmen). \\n The second major event was the Prohibitory Act, which was in effect a declaration of war by King George III. Passed in late 1775, news of it reached the colonists early in 1776. The Act forbade all trade with the American colonies. All American ships were to be treated as belonging to a foreign power and their goods seized as such. In response to the Prohibitory Act John Adams [wrote a letter]( to Horatio Gates, where he basically credited King George as giving the final push for independence: \\n >I know not whether you have seen the Act of Parliament call'd the restraining Act, or prohibitory Act, or piratical Act, or plundering Act, or  Act of Independency , for by all these Titles is it call'd. I think the most apposite is the Act of Independency, for King Lords and Commons have united in Sundering this Country and that I think forever. It is a compleat Dismemberment of the British Empire. It throws thirteen Colonies out of the Royal Protection, levels all Distinctions and makes us independent in Spight of all our supplications and Entreaties. \\n > It may be fortunate that the Act of Independency should come from the British Parliament, rather than the American Congress : But it is very odd that Americans should hesitate at accepting Such a Gift from them. \\n So in the spring of 1776 there was a perfect storm of events--the news of King George looking to hire foreign mercenaries (he had first approached Russia), the news of the Prohibitory Act, and then  Common Sense . \\n Edit: \\n Part of the supposed impact of Paine's  Common Sense  on the push for independence was actually set up by Paine himself. Supposedly  Common Sense  sold 100,000 copies within the first six months. Or was it the first three months? Or the first year? Or maybe it was 120,000? Or 150,000 thousand? Or 500,000? All three of those are numbers which are basically made up. The 120,000 number was something Paine pulled out of his hat in responding to a critic (to have sold 120,000 copies  Common Sense  would have needed to have been purchased by 1 out of every 5 free households in America--this despite it only getting 16 print runs). The 150,000 number also came from Paine in a letter that Paine wrote to Henry Laurens in 1789. The 100,000 copies sold came from a footnote to  Rights of Man  (published in 1791). \\n The 500k number came from a biography written about Paine in 1892 (to have sold 500k copies Paine would have needed to sell a copy to every single free household in America). \\n Ray Raphael goes into more detail about the problems with Paine's numbers in [this]( essay for the Journal of the American Revolution. \\n TL;DR \\n While  Common Sense  was undoubtedly popular and probably swayed many people, it wasn't the juggernaut that has come down to us from history. Also important were policy decisions made by King George III (hiring of foreign troops and the Prohibitory Act among them), and the work of thousands of individuals who were committed to independence. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('The Ottoman Sultanate became the Empire as it grew, and Caliphate refers to a specific claim to Islamic hegemony.

However, I would say that these problems are quite widespread.  Classes generally revolve around the textbook, especially in this age of standardized tests (citywide, statewide, etc.).  If the test is based on the textbook, and teachers diverge too much from it, then both the teacher and school face consequences.  Teachers often bring in supplementary materials, and can skip some material in the text, but they better be careful not to skip anything that is on the standardized test...Or spend too much time away from it. \\n While there are literally thousands of different school systems across the country, there are a limited number of textbooks available.

I do have a few more questions though. \\n > In the Middle Ages though all the scientists in the West were in the Church and the people who brought Islamic science to Europe were in the Church. \\n If we restrict what the idea of Church to the main ruling body of the Catholic church, I would definitely agree with you, but the proper meaning of \"Christian Church\" includes the body of all Christianity, not only the ruling minority -- which is why e.g. the Catholic church stands at 1.1 bilion members today. \\n Of course, many (most?) of the scientists of the day were members of the clergy, but this was mainly due to this being effectively one of the very few positions that allowed access to the documentation. The Jewish philosophers in the Christian lands, prior to the Renaissance, were probably the notable exception to this, but mainly since they didn\\'t have access to the Christian universities (on account of them, well, not being Christian). \\n But I find it very difficult to decouple the Church, both as a body of believers and as an institution, from the sectarian violences (even up to the 20th century, as the KKK was explicitly based on a Christian fundament) inside the church to the violences against other religions (of which the Crusades are one example, but not the only one) and the dismantlement of any non-Christian scientific institution in the late antiquity. While today we know that much of the horrific stories about burning people on the stakes were really just stories, can we honestly say that there was an overall climate of tolerance which encouraged scientific progress of the  actual  kind? We can of course define progress to mean anything (like, say, getting closer to God and his creation -- arguably the fundamentalist regime of Iran is doing that, as far as they\\'re concerned) but it sounds like an easy way out to me. \\n tl ; dr Do you think the climate of ethnic, religious and inter-religious violence (and, to some extent, political, as the Pope was, at times, an important political player) which was arguably maintained by the Church (from its ruling body to its adherents) during the Middle Ages was actually beneficial to science? If not, do you think it played an important impact over scientific development? \\n',\n  0),\n ('There are a few reasons, but we need to address the nature of \"the rest of the Nile\" and the fact that it\\'s not simply open ground and disorganized people there.  The river\\'s not the same in Egypt as it is in (modern) Sudan, and the areas to the south were a functioning network of trade links and small kingdoms. \\n The Nile valley south of Egypt is a region generally known to historians (generically) as \"Kush.\"  Kush was the site of a succession of significant kingdoms, starting with the one  centered on Kerma before c.1500BCE  is also a lot harder because by definition you can\\'t take boats over it.  North of that, you have a current going north and prevailing winds going south, making the movement of goods and troops a lot easier. \\n Another reason for non-conquest is that without that trade profit the Nile basin further south has much less productive value.  The agricultural surplus obtained--a great deal of Egypt\\'s value to Rome, as you note--diminishes rapidly when you hit the cataracts.  The floodplain narrows considerably.  So the payoff wasn\\'t going to be very high in any case, though we don\\'t know how much this factored into considerations of conquest or tribute.  There\\'s also that navigation issue, so any grains moved across the cataracts would need to be trans-shipped via land past those areas, raising the cost and the time involved. [Edit: I can\\'t believe I forgot the other issue: what crops would grow.  The grains that grow in the southern part of the valley are not the same as in the north; sorghum, finger millet, and other \"summer-rain\" crops flourish, and wheat, etc., don\\'t do nearly as well without a huge amount of intervention.  So that\\'s another potential barrier.] \\n One final reason may have to do with parasitology.  Malaria and other tropical diseases were a problem in Egypt, but they were far more prevalent--indeed endemic--to the south.  Horses?  They die, fast.  Soldiers, even from the Mediterranean coast?

Part of the reason it became possible was ironically the Romans themselves.  In order to try to bring the various Berber clans to heel in the Maghreb and collect tribute, they imported the Arabian camel as a mount.  These rapidly found their way into Berber hands, and made a sporadic and arduous crossing with oxen significantly less so, and eventually would re-open trade routes that closed around the time of Carthage\\'s fall.

Well, World War Two has also been turned into a story - a very important and intensely used one. Used by politicians, nation-states, and individuals, who are all invested in the story being told with a particular set of meanings. And traditionally one of the dominant underlying narratives of the Second World War is that for the Allies it was a \"Good\" war. A \"Justly fought\" one. That the generation that fought it were the \"greatest\", and that those men and women who served deserve unconditional respect for it. Essentially, the narrative stresses that the allies were the \"good guys\". \\n This, in turn, means that the enemy is the \"baddie\" - the villain. The greater the story, the greater the villain, and the greater the good in stopping him. As I said before – World War Two is a big, intensely used story. We use it in our everyday lives ((probably the most obvious way is in the idea that \\'real\\' veterans are older (or at least this association is the case in New Zealand).)) Politicians use its tropes and meanings quite blatantly sometimes (but politics is a bad place for a historian to go, so I shan\\'t.) \\n In summary of the above; with anything like this, parts of the story and some of the characters build up \"charge\". Those historical things are turned into tropes; tropes that are drenched in meaning. Simply using them instantly conjures up a whole bunch of associations - there is a richness of understanding borne of being linked into a certain place in a narrative. Stalin wasn\\'t in the main English-speaking narrative – the Good (western) Allies verses the bad Nazi Germany – and so he never built the charge in our language that accrued to Hitler. \\n Events being turned into a story isn\\'t necessarily a bad thing. It is difficult to imagine how World War Two could be talked about if it weren\\'t; without providing some sort of framework for understanding then millions of voices, situations, and experiences would be jumbled together without any ability to structure it by time or theme. It would be chaos - and thus meaningless. And so we wouldn\\'t talk about it. \\n TL;DR Hitler is the villain in one of the grandest historical stories English-speaking societies have. Stalin is not. \\n',\n  0),\n ('To avoid about a million tangents, I\\'ll just answer by saying that the Second World War was a war of  force , while the Cold War was much more abstract. \\n The Allies knew that all they had to do was  beat  the Nazis in a real, physical sense. It was a show of military force. The Holocaust and the Nuremburg Trials sort of cloud the issue, because even though these events were in a sense  part  of the war, they had little to do with what American leaders were really concerned with, and in a way serve to add a measure of ideological haze to the entire conflict. You have to remember that the events of the Holocaust were not the reason Americans became involved in the war, and an efficient study of the conflict must keep them separate, to a degree. \\n Anyway, as I was saying, the Nazis had to be beaten by force. While the Allies feared a Third Reich empire, they were not concerned with other nations actively  adopting  the system. There was then, and is now, plenty of evidence that a fascist political system is not something that is necessarily appealing, unless the right circumstances are there, and certainly not something that is easy to maintain without strong, central leadership. In this way the Nazis could sort of be seen as an \"evil Rome\", the sort of system that will disintegrate once it\\'s head has been cut off. \\n The Cold War was different. Communism was an appealing idea to many nations at the time. The fear was different; during the Cold War, military prowess didn\\'t really matter (even if you take the Bomb out of the equation), because in a sense there was nobody to fight, no head to cut off. Americans were fighting an idea, and the fear was different because an idea doesn\\'t need to storm the beaches in order to take hold at home. Although the two are wildly different in many ways, the fear of Communism was more similar to the American fear of terrorism today; something that spreads and gains traction no matter the power of your standing army. \\n TL;DR: American fear of Nazism needed only manifest militarily, American fear of Communism was more abstract. I don\\'t think Hitler\\'s legacy played into the Cold War much, nor do I think it was a traditional conflict of leaders pitted against leaders, so much as ideologies at odds. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"I'll take the question on Akhenaten, and leave the3manhimself to fill in any blanks I leave when he logs on. \\n Akhenaten (born Amenhotep IV) was revered as Pharaoh, of course. He was a god-king and held absolute and infallible power, and in Year 5 of his reign he packed up the entire capital city and moved it to Amarna, a place untouched by human settlements, and constructed an entirely new city from nothing. He also proclaimed, not mono-theism (that would come later), but the supremacy of a relatively obscure deity, the Aten (or Sun-disk) over the rest of the Egyptian pantheon. \\n The capital move was a massive job, and it put thousands of people of the lower classes in a tight bind. They could pack up their entire lives and move to the new capital, or stay and be out of work. Many moved, and the city of Akhetaten flourished for a while. In Year 9 of Akenaten's reign he proclaimed the Aten as the singular deity, making him the earliest recorded monotheist. The people begrudgingly accepted this, as it threw out thousands of years of religious convention, but he was Pharaoh so what could they do? He also mostly ignored his international relations, and the vast Egyptian empire shrank as he focused his wealth and power on Akhetaten, his safe haven. \\n Akhenaten died years later after a healthy reign, and long after his famous wife Nefertiti disappeared from historic record. Coming after him was his son-in-law Smenkhkhare, and after him the famous Tutankhamun (born to Akhenaten as Tutankhaten). Tut was repulsed by his father's religious policies and in an effort to garner more favour from the general populace and to improve the morale of the state, he reinstated the traditional gods, disbanded the cult of the Aten, and relocated the captial from Akhetaten back to Thebes. Despite his efforts, after his premature death, most records of Akhenaten were expunged. His name was chiseled out of cartouches wherever they were found, his face was similarly destroyed from wall carvings, as were the names of Akhenaten's wives and children. \\n Personally I find Akhenaten fascinating, and the Amarna period as one of the richest deviations from thousands of years of standard Egyptian art. His blurring of gender lines through the Amarna style of art and the ideal of the male and female bodies becoming more similar was drastically different from art from the previous periods. \\n tl;dr Both. He was a hero in life to the people who lived in Amarna, but a menace to those in the surrounding cities and provinces which he ignored. The  damnatio memoriae  which occurred after his death is further proof of the attitude the Egyptian people had towards him. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"I'm not actually a panelist, but I did write an MA thesis on Ramesside cosmology and star lore, so if I might, I'd like to add that the Orion correlation theory absolutely drives me crazy.

[Vampire_Seraphin]( is probably the person to ask here. However, I had to chime in because there are several inaccuracies in your post. \\n While most of what you are saying isn\\'t necessarily wrong (some of it is) you are conflating several centuries of shipbuilding technology into an artificial construct you term the \"Viking ship\". \\n If we want to come to grips with the phenomenon of the Viking ship we first have to understand that there is no such thing. Not only were the ships used in late Iron Age and medieval Scandinavia subject to considerable change during the Viking Age and later they also were influenced by and influenced neighbouring shipbuilding traditions such as those of the Slavs, the Balts, the Scottish, etc. \\nLet me illustrate this with a few examples: \\n Just like today there were also different types of ship for different uses. Consider  these two ships . The upper one is a warship, optimized to transport a large number of men and little cargo. It can be rowed efficiently and can therefore be manoveured independently of prevailing winds if necessary. The lower ship is a cargo vessel. It is optimized to carry a large cargo with a small crew. It only has a few oarports and must be sailed most of the time. \\n Now consider  these  the latter from its very end (c. 1042). They clearly belong to the same building tradition but they couldn\\'t be more different. \\n As a last example let\\'s look at this [ship]( It looks like a Viking ship but it isn\\'t. In fact it\\'s a Slavic boat of the same time. \\n \\n Now that that is out of the way let\\'s look at some of your points. \\n > • Sails - The ships where fitted with large, square sails, which allowed for surprisingly high speeds when sailing directly downwind. This may well also be put in the con column, because the sails where useless when sailing against the wind (as in they did not allow for the crossing way we use with modern sail boats fitted triangular sails), forcing the sailors to used oars. \\n All nordic ships did indeed have square rigged sails (at least from the point on when they had sails at all). However, experiments have shown that they could sail against the wind with those even if this wasn\\'t very effective. Using oars for long periods of time (i.e. for actual travel) wouldn\\'t have been feasible in the long term, especially for trading voyages. \\n > • No proper storage space, rendering them less useful as trading vessels. \\n There are several problems with this statement. As I have shown there were dedicated cargo vessels after some point in the tenth century. So storage space was not a problem. \\n > • Again, storage - there really was no proper place to mount a cannon on a long-boat. \\n This was no problem since cannon didn\\'t exist in Europe during the Viking Age and the early Middle Ages. \\n > The sails, as mentioned. Really, advances in sails and weaponry really made these vessels obsolete. IIRC it was in a naval battle against Hanseatic traders, where a fleet of norwegian long-boats faced off against a fleet of something like a proto-carrack, that displayed that continental ship-building had surpassed that of the scandinavians (this was sometime in around 1290, can\\'t find the exact date, nor the exact description of the german boats in my sources). \\n 1290 is about 200 years after the end of the Viking Age. It is difficult to speak about Viking ships at this point. However, ships built in the nordic tradition were indeed still used in Norway at the time, as part of the so-called ledung fleet. They could be seen as the descendants of Viking ships. It is indeed true that these kinds of ships were inferior to cogs in naval combat because of their low freeboard and lack of castles, therefore being vulnerable to attacks from above. \\n > Pros: • General design - They are broad ships, that lie low in the water, making them very stable, allowing for trans-atlantic voyages (albeit with relay on Iceland). Also the wood used (or the way said wood was put together, i don\\'t remember) made them quite flexible, allowing the ship to absorb waves better than the contemporary galleys \\n This is basically true. Scandinavian ships were  clinker-built . This does indeed make them a bit more flexible than carvel-built ships (i.e. where the strakes abut). It should be noted, however, that all this flexing also makes them more leaky. Whether they were better suited for transatlantic voyages than other ships of the time remains an open question. But since hanseatic cogs were used in the Norway trade and may even have reached Iceland I personally doubt it. \\n > • Design pt. 2 - As I see others have mentioned, the low and broad build of the ship would have eased dragging them on land with the aid of logs. Personally I doubt this would have been used much other than to take the ship out of water for repairs/putting it sea after it was built etc. As my history teacher said when speaking of pre-modern Norway: \"Land separates, the sea connects.\" As in, it was much more feasible undertaking to sail around than cross by land. \\n This is spot on! I think too much has been made of the fact that Scandinavian ships could be dragged overland. It was possible and we have textual evidence that this was practised but I think most ships (expecially cargo vessels) were only dragged on land for maintenance and overwintering. (I could expand on my reasons to think this but this post is getting far too long anyway). \\n So where does my slightly incoherent rambling leave us? ( TL;DR ) What is popularily known as the \"Viking ship\" is actually a complex shipbuilding tradition that emerged from the war boats of the Iron Age and was largely superseded by the Frisian cog tradition in the High Middle Ages but still lives on in local boatbuilding traditions around the Baltic and North Sea and the North Atlantic. It is still not fully understood, especially when it comes to influences by neighbouring traditions. Some of these ships were good trading vessels, some were good warships. There is no real evidence that they were superior to other ships of the time. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Gerald Gardner started Wicca in the 50\\'s it is a revival movement but has little actual historical ancidents. you won\\'t find paganism in Europe between christian Rome and it\\'s revival in the 50\\'s, because, as a formal continuous religious tradition, it did not exist. \\n so, Wicca is a postmodern return to an idealized tradition that never really existed. on the plus side, that means you can make up whatever you like and it will be just as valid an expression of your own internal interpretation of the faith as anything ancient.

The early Americans were not Americans, they were British (English). They already had well established trade routes to Africa & Asia. Around the time North America was discovered most of Europe was trying to find a shorter way to get to India the golden sparrow of that time and hence had stumbled upon many trade routes on the western coast of Africa and established ports there as you\\'ll see in the map below (this is before Suez canal was built). \\n [Here\\'s a map of colonies in Africa by European nations]( \\n After America\\'s independence there was already a well established business of importing slaves from Africa & India to West Indies & Fiji. By this time America was still largely unexplored and the large French colony west of the Mississippi (Louisiana) largely used their land only as resource to fuel their slaves in the sugarcane farms in the West Indies. \\n As the newly formed American government started to explore west they began expanding their territory as the French & Spanish gradually seceded their land. Before the colonizing of North America there was already a system of slavery among the different Native American tribes and when they were defeated by British/American raids the Native Americans began selling war captives from previous conquests to whites rather than integrating them into their own societies. \\n The West Indies developed as plantation societies prior to the Chesapeake Bay region and had a demand for labor. Colonists in the South began to capture and enslave Native Americans for sale and export to the \"sugar islands,\" as well as to northern colonies.The resulting Native American slave trade devastated the southeastern Native American populations and transformed tribal relations throughout the Southeast. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the English at Charles Town (South Carolina), the Spanish in Florida, and the French in Louisiana sought trading partners and allies among the Native Americans by offering trade goods such as metal knives and axes, firearms and ammunition, liquor and beads, and cloth and hats in exchange for furs (deerskins) and Native American slaves. Traders, frontier settlers, and government officials encouraged Native Americans to make war on other tribes to reap the profits of the slaves captured in such raids or to weaken the warring tribes. \\n More info here: \\n TL;DR: The Native Americans foung amongst each other and kept the war captives as slaves. When they were defeated by the colonists, the ruling native american leaders traded their slaves. \\n',\n  0),\n ('This actually links into a broader debate about the nature of military organization in the time period. The 16th century saw many changes in military organization and tactics from the previous century. The [Battle of Marignano]( was fought between the French and the Swiss Confederacy. Pikes, cannon, and the heavy  gendarme  cavalry of the French army dominated the day. Compare that to the [Battle of Agincourt]( in 1415, which is a much more stereotypical \"medieval\" battle fought between the French and English. The French heavy cavalry was bogged down in the mud, where they died under hails of longbow fire and the swords of the English. \\n So what accounts for this change? The first person to really attempt to label that was Michael Roberts with his 1955 article \"The Military Revolution: 1560-1660.\" He argued that the change in military tactics was a revolution in tactics and strategy brought about by technological shifts such as the widespread adoption of gunpowder and the gradual phasing out of mass pike formations. However, later scholars like Geoffrey Parker in \"The \"Military Revolution,\" 1560-1660--a Myth?\" (1976) and Clifford J. Rogers in \"The Military Revolutions of the Hundred Years\\' War\" argued that the supposed \"military revolution\" was not a drastic overthrow of previous military norms at all, but a gradual evolution of tactics and organization. \\n That being said, I do think the period of 1450-1570 experienced a shift from \"medieval\" methods of combat to systems that can be described as \"early modern\" (albeit not a sudden or even drastic one). Although gunpowder was not new to the military scene, it had not truly been utilized to its full effectiveness in Western European combat before the mid 1400s. Charles VII of France bought new artillery for his armies to smash English fortresses and armies in France (like at the [Battle of Castillon]( The Spanish armies of Ferdinand of Aragon and his wife Isabella also expanded their arsenals of gunpowder artillery to besiege the last Moorish fortresses in Spain. \\n Infantry organization also experienced shifts. Many armies began imitating the mass pike formations of the Swiss Confederacy after their successes in the Burgundian Wars. German  landsknecht  mercenaries and the  tercios  of the Spanish crown deliberately modeled themselves after the Swiss. They also began to adopt new handheld firearms like the arquebus, which the Swiss never really employed on a wide scale. With these new formations and organizations, new terms arose to describe their officers. Many of their commanders and leaders were not nobles, and therefore could not use a knightly title like \"Duke\" to describe their rank. \\n Let\\'s look at a case example from your list. The word \"colonel\" is originally Spanish. It comes from a unit called a  colunella . The officer in charge was a \"colonel.\" The  colunella  evolves very shortly into the  tercio,  a unit divided into three brigades. The name derives from \"tercer\" or \"third.\" Although the name of the formation was changed, the title of its commander, \"colonel,\" did not. The rank may have passed to the English language from the French, or the English might have picked up the word in the [conflicts]( between England and Spain later in that century. \\n tl;dr: The 16th century saw a number of military changes that resulted in the creation of new vocabulary to describe military ranks. \\n Hope that helps! \\n',\n  0),\n ('Part 2 \\n Scientific objection to inbreeding arises in the mid-1850s.

However, the question of marriages of consanguinity and affinity had been debated by the public in religious and legalistic term during the 1820s-1840s. Biologically, earlier work undertaken by Sir William Wilde, father of Oscar Wilde, in 1851 at the time of the census and published in 1854 showed an association between deaf and dumb children and consanguineous marriages. [Full text pg 38]( \\n Finally in France similar to Great Britain, the early 1800s saw numerous debates about legal and religious prohibition on close kin and close affinity marriages. In 1856, two publications addressed consanguity. Dr. M Rilliet observed the \"pernicious\" results of inbreeding including reduced conception and monstrositites, imperfect physical and mental organization, tendency to diseases of the nervous system, and tendency to die young in the progeny. Dr. Meniere focused on the link between consanguinity and deaf-mutes. \\n The debate over inbreeding and its effect on health continued into the 20th century. As a result, in the United States individual states passed bans on consanguineous marriages and criminalizing some incestuous relationships. In Great Britain laws became more permissable to only exclude closely related family member incest including grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece, and nephew. Similarly in France the Napoleonic code which prohibited only close relatedness inbreeding (parent-child, uncle-niece, aunt-nephew, and brother-sister) was retained. \\n TL:DR Inbreeding was prohibited under canon law and therefore secular law for religious reasons throughout Medieval Europe. Although Richard Burton in 1621 justified these laws as preventing hereditary diseases, there was limited contemporary evidence of a connection between birth defects and consanguinity. Those defects observed were viewed to be evidence of God\\'s punishment not a naturally occuring biological consequences. By the early Modern era, natural causes of physical and mental debilities included conditions of conception, mental and physical state of the mother, moral character particularly in reference to mental illnesses, and hereditary disorders. In the mid-1850s the scientific communities in the US and Europe began to investigate the role of inbreeding in mental and physical diseases with many initial studies finding a strong positive association.

That said a few are still lost every year. The main reason for their safety is threefold, radar, radio, and self contained propulsion.

In addition if they are lost generally at least their general position is known. \\n Sailing craft lack that option.

I'll expand upon it a little bit as that was a fairly brief summary of a very complex topic. /u/i8ontario is completely right that international support for military intervention was very, very strong in the immediate aftermath of UDI. Most of the African states, plus Russia, China and most non-colonial nations were explicit in demanding military action within the UN. Why Britain didn't invade therefore needs explaining. \\n First, it is crucial to note that neither the British government nor the British public were unanimously of the opinion that force should be ruled out. Opinion was actually very divided for a variety of reasons, but a lot of the reasons that were made public belied other factors. When Harold Wilson, the British PM, announced to a Rhodesian press conference on 30 October, 1965 that \\n >If there are those in this country who are thinking in terms of a thunderbolt, hurtling through the sky and destroying the enemy, a thunderbolt in the shape of the Royal Air Force, let me say that his thunderbolt will not be coming, and to continue in this delusion wastes valuable time and misdirects valuable energies (Elaine Windrich,  Britain and the Politics of Rhodesian Independence  (New York, 1978), p.49) \\n he was almost certainly refuting the statement another British minister, Arthur Bottomley (Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, 1964-66), had made a month earlier when Bottomley had declared that British military intervention would being considered if either the Rhodesian Governor (Sir Humphrey Gibbs) or the Zambian government called for it.  The reasons why Wilson did not want military intervention in Rhodesia in case of UDI were many, and include the reasons my quoted answer provides. First, that the Rhodesian military would be able to drag a war out indefinitely, and secondly, that the British troops would be unwilling to fight Rhodesian forces. \\n Both of these fears were to an extent justified. The Rhodesian military was certainly strong enough to make any British-led invasion a costly (both in terms of lives and money) and protracted war. There have been suggestions that in the case of a British military intervention, the Africans would likely have provided enough support to the invasion force to render the Rhodesian state impotent, but such beliefs were unfounded and rare amongst the British decision makers. The second argument, that the British troops might hesitate to fire upon Rhodesian 'kith and kin' had a little more support. When the British were still considering military action in 1965, air photographs of dropping zones and other information related to 'somewhere in Africa' were issued to D Squadron of the SAS (at the time in Aden) who would likely be the first troops into Rhodesia. \\n >  This led to a secret poll among the SAS ordinary ranks on the question: ‘If the order to go to Rhodesia is given, would you be willing to fight?’ Most men were not, and, even though they understood they could not refuse a direct command, they indicated they would seek to avoid a confrontation with the Rhodesians. It is believed that this had a ripple effect in British ranks in Aden and contributed to Wilson’s final decision to rule out the use of force. Although it is certain that any British reluctance to fire on their Rhodesian brothers-in-arms would have dissipated with the first British casualty, such a factor would still have been taken into consideration. (J.R.T. Wood,  'So Far and No Further' , p.425) \\n Andrew Skeen, the last High Commissioner in Rhodesia and a military officer in the British army, also suggested that most British commanders would refuse to fight and that some had even declared they would join the Rhodesians in protecting the last bastion of white Britain in Africa. Dennis Healey (Minister of Defence) also emphasised that leaving aside the psychological problems of British troops fighting Rhodesian troops, there were not only the logistical difficulties of a British or UN intervention in Rhodesia, but also the danger of provoking Rhodesia into launching pre-emptive strikes against Zambia or sabotaging the Kariba hydroelectric station (on the Zambian border) and thereby shutting down Zambia's copper production. However, Joseph Grimmond (leader of the opposition Liberal Party) and Edward Heath (leader of the Conservatives) were both supportive of military action, until UDI was declared when they both agreed to focus on economic and political sanctions. \\n Secondly, Wilson and the British government argued that the British public would not have supported military action. Carl Watts' article ‘Killing Kith and Kin' (see footnote) asserted that the British public was both ill-informed on the issue of the military intervention and the Rhodesian crisis (and would therefore not understand the necessity of military action), and also that there was a vocal minority (about 22% of the British public) who explicitly supported the use of force against an independent Rhodesia. My own research into the issue of the British press, British public opinion and military action against Rhodesia has suggested that on the basis of a statistical analysis of the quantity of news articles regarding the use of armed force against Rhodesia, the prominent positioning of articles within the newspaper, and the relative ‘attractiveness’ of the articles’ headlines, the issue of military action against Rhodesia was undoubtedly a salient issue in the public agenda in the immediate aftermath of UDI. My research has also concluded that public opinion was certainly not unanimous in the aftermath of UDI, with a pro-force minority making justifiable arguments against an anti-force majority for British military intervention with the purpose of forestalling an invasion of Rhodesia from a foreign power. Watts' figure of 22% of the British public in support of military action, working off Gallup Polls from 1964 and 1965, and my research with newspapers from the period of UDI has affirmed that figure to be roughly accurate. In the immediate aftermath of UDI, it is justified to state that around three-quarters of the public were opposed to any military action, and often even to Wilson’s desire to crush the Smith regime. In response to an editorial alleging the entire British population was behind Wilson’s punitive measures against Rhodesia, one sardonic letter written to the  Daily Mail  stated quite simply that ‘the claim that a great measure of unity in confronting Rhodesia exists in Britain may turn out to be the overstatement of the year.’ (Implying that the unity came from support for Rhodesia). \\n There were some public voices, however, which went further and made clear the negative repercussions military action would have for Wilson’s Labour Party, as was emphasised in unambiguous terms in one blunt letter to the  Daily Mail ;\\n>if Mr. Wilson considers – or allows – force to be used in Rhodesia he will have to be prepared for a large number of Smethwicks. \\n The town of Smethwick saw race riots in 1962 and the subsequent unseating of a Labour MP after apparent preferential treatment given to immigrant ethnic-minority parts of the population. The unofficial campaign slogan put about by the protesters was ‘if you want a nigger for a neighbour, vote Labour.’  Certainly, Wilson was aware that the majority of the British public would be uncomfortable about any use of force against those white Rhodesians who were 'simply protecting their lifestyle from the savage Africans.' \\n Finally, most of these factors come from the period immediately after UDI. So why didn't Britain invade later on? Well, simply put, it was because from around 1965 onwards the white Rhodesians found themselves engaged in a civil war with African nationalist forces. Britain had no intention of getting involved in the Liberation War to any extent, preferring instead to focus on the economic and political sanctions it had implemented. The only official British military presence in Rhodesia came in 1979 when a token peacekeeping British force was dispatched to ensure a peaceful transition from minority to majority rule. Rhodesia remained an embarrassment to the broader policy of decolonization and subsequently Britain preferred for the issue to be resolved without the use of force. The belief put forward by the British government during the 1960s, and 70s was that the Rhodesian Front government of Ian Smith would die a natural death at the hands of the African nationalist forces and the economic sanctions. \\n Anyhow, the  tl;dr  of why Britain did not invade is that the British government, press, and public were all relatively opposed to military force, and despite a vocal minority calling for war, the logistical problems, the strength of the Rhodesian military, and the belief that both British soldiers and the British public would not support any military action saw Britain to remain content with economic and political sanctions. \\n For those interested here are the references for the quotes from that earlier answer, plus a very short list of suggested further reading.

With this in mind, it would be logical that  all  inter-provincial commodity exchange would decrease. \\n That said, the eastern Empire remained wealthy independent of the decline of the west. The cities of the Levant continued to export goods abroad until the fall of the Gupta.

Graves' sources for information on these individuals were the Roman historians, Suetonius in particular.  For complicated reasons, there was bad blood between the Emperors and the Senatorial class, and our historians - who align themselves with the senators - delighted in painting the Emperors as decadent, debauched, morally corrupt, and generally unpleasant people.  (Caligula and Nero, it's theorized, were  especially  hated and slandered by the senatorial historians because they were populists who sought the praise of the plebs and treated the Senate especially harshly.  I vaguely recall - and I have no idea from where, so feel free to ignore this aside - that there is evidence of Nero being worshiped by members of the plebs a hundred years after the Senate condemned his memory.  They loved the guy.)  This tendency was only heightened by the classical style of biography-by-anecdote:  the purpose of biography was moral, and a striking incident from an Emperor's personal life - which would demonstrate his fundamental moral character - was as valuable (or more valuable!) than legal or political or military issues.  So our Imperial historiography is full of fascinating, compelling stories of dubious historical legitimacy. \\n Graves' claim that  I, Claudius  is translated from Claudius' own writings, of course, is  absolute bullshit  poetic license.  Claudius was a historian himself, but his writings did not survive.  Anything Graves tells us about what Claudius himself was thinking is Graves' own invention of his character.  Most of the major events in the book  are  based on references and stories from the ancient Roman historians, but those historians were biased against Claudius and his family, and Graves, IIRC, embellishes those stories somewhat.  (Of course, some of them didn't need much embellishment.) \\n tl:dr; there was a Claudius, and he did become Emperor.

In addition to the genuine opera-goers noise, singers would commonly hire groups of people called 'claques,' who were professional clappers, and would hoot and holler when their employer was on stage, and boo and hiss when his or her rivals were singing. ( Encyclopedia article on claques \\n In baroque and classical opera eras the wealthy people would have subscriptions to an opera box, and would be free to decorate it however they wanted and do whatever they wanted in it (including not paying any attention to the opera at all and playing card games and having sex) and people would also go visiting between the boxes throughout the evening. \\n Poorer people would sit on the bottom of the theater (ironically the most expensive seats today.) There were rough wooden benches, and as seats were not assigned, people would commonly send their servants to save them a seat hours ahead of the performance. Also, the rich people in the boxes would occasionally spit on them to amuse themselves. \\n So that's what opera was like in the 18th century -- sort of a salon for rich people, which no one took as Super Serious Art. \\n Enter Napoleon:  Napoleon was fond of Italian opera, and made a point of visiting the Paris Opera when he was in town. He would commonly come in to his box mid-way through the performance and everyone, including the performers, would stop and applaud him. \\n Napoleon, in his various reforms, brought in the rise of upper-middle class people (which I won't go in to in great detail), but it meant that people who before could not afford opera were interested in going. However, these people were not aristocracy willing to rent an opera box for the whole season, no, they wanted to go and see Napoleon, and they wanted buy box tickets for one or two performances. \\n So opera saw a sudden influx of people who were not used to opera, and who were not attending regularly. In addition, strangers would be put into a box together, which would obviously cut down on the sex and card playing fun. People started being quiet and paying attention to the entire opera for the entire time, mostly out of awkwardness at being in a new class status and being around strangers. \\n I am pulling the majority of the Napoleon story out of an excellent book called [ The Gilded Stage: A Social History of Opera. ]( \\n TLDR: The influx of non-aristocratic, non-opera-regulars quieted rowdy opera down in the 1820s, and opera crowds have never recovered! \\n\",\n  0),\n ('Really there’re just two major differences that I can speak on with confidence. First, Brazil has different hurdles to leap over because of colonization. Second, Brazil arrived late to the industrial revolution party the US and Europe had thrown from the 1820s until the tail-end of the 1800s. \\n I recommend this book: \\n It’s very easy to read and shouldn’t take more than a week. \\n When the Portuguese began their colonization of Brazil, their purpose was to expand the crown’s political and economic reach. Remember, Portugal is tiny relative to other European countries and a drop of water in a gallon jug compared to Brazil. To make up for its limitations, Brazil became Portugal’s export garden and a dandy tourist attraction later on in the 1700-1800s. \\n Portugal made most of its money from the mid 1500s to the end of the 1600s on sugarcane production based in Brazil. Coffee, corn, and cattle made up for any shortcomings or competition against Portugal’s near monopoly of the stuff (the Dutch and the Caribbean provided competition for Portugal through this time-period). A gold and diamond rush, coffee and corn plantations, and cattle all become important to Brazil’s economic growth from the 1600s until, albeit at a lesser extent, today. \\n It is also important to note that slaves were abundant—about 2 million were brought via the Atlantic slave trade until abolishment in 1888, which was forced upon Brazil by the UK (I recommend  It’s a text I used in school.) Not only that, but there was plenty of reproductive integration between slaves, natives, and colonizers throughout Brazil’s history \\n . The US abolished slavery in 1865. The formation of Brazilian culture was confusing, often unclear. The US kept a firm identity, with patriotism and unification crucial to the US’s economic development, especially during President Roosevelt’s isolationist government. Brazil is much more of a melting pot, where the US is a stew with clearly cut pieces of different races and ethnicities. Brazil hadn’t established political or economic identity independent of Portugal \\n That might not seem like much difference, but I’ll give you one of the last puzzle pieces for your own education… \\n The industrial revolution started in the 1700s, peaked in the early 1800s, and finally settled down as the industrial age by the 1840s. Slaves in the US weren’t an economic necessity to production anymore. The US was shifting to a manufacturing society. Brazil still had in the works the Land Act of 1820 (a by-law claimed that property was an inalienable right, which directly upheld slavery in Brazil) and the Land Law of 1850 (a by-law stated that anyone who migrated to Brazil did not have the option to acquire land, thus keeping slaves from using any possible purchasing power they had conjured up through labor benefits.) \\n Once the second industrial revolution came about beginning of the 1900s, “third world” countries like Brazil were playing catch-up to those lucky enough to have been heavily involved in the first wave. The US taking part in WW1 and WW2, manufacturing all kinds of goods and providing employment post-depression, slingshot the economy. Brazil was still playing a slow game of agro-business and international trade, dealing with the economic and political implications of abolishing slavery, and forming a unified political identity. \\n You don’t even want to touch the incredibly volatile, shifty economic policy the country has followed over the last 70 years… ( is a good start though…) \\n TL;DR: They have very different economic histories.

World War Two is an important story . \\n A historian needs to remember there is something called \"charge\"; alas it is difficult to describe the effects of it without sounding flaky, but but I shall try, because the way history is used and retold - remembered essentially - creates a story. \\n The problem with stories is that they carry meaning, even if we didn\\'t intend it to. A story priorities some events over others, makes some characters more important, and generally imposes order onto chaotic experiences - and thus gives meaning to that something that was chaotic. A narrative has a beginning, a middle, and an end. It has characters and events. Some events are more important than others. Historians try to minimize their bias as much as they can, but it is still there (as evidenced by a simple read-through of von Ranke, for instance, the first historian to declare he would \"tell only the things that actually happened\".) \\n What does this random theoretical segue have to do with Hitler fighting the Allies, with the Japanese bombing Pearl Harbour? Well, World War Two has also been turned into a story - a very important and intensively used one. Used by politicians, nation-states, and individuals, who are all invested in the story being told with a particular set of meanings. And traditionally one of the dominant underlying narratives of the Second World War is that for the Allies it was a \"Good\" war. A \"Justly fought\" one. That the generation that fought it were the \"greatest\", and that those men and women who served deserve unconditional respect for it. Essentially, the narrative stresses that the allies were the \"good guys\", and that war justifies the West\\'s moral and political framework. (\"Democracy over Fascism\", etc.) \\n This, in turn, means that the enemy must be the \"baddie\" - the villain. This is despite the real complexity of peoples\\' lived experiences (which comes through more clearly in wars not so fundamentally  used ).  The greater the story, the greater the villain, and the greater the good in stopping him. As I said before – World War Two is a big, intensely used story. We use it in our everyday lives. Politicians use its tropes and meanings quite blatantly sometimes (but politics is a bad place for a historian to go, so I shan\\'t.) Other speakers resistant to this black-and-white narrative being challenged are the veterans themselves. At the moment they are allowed a very privileged place in the story; they are the \"real heroes\", the \"greatest\", and if the war became as messy as Vietnam then they would lose that special status. \\n In summary of the above; with anything like this, the story and some of the characters build up \"charge\". Historical events are turned into tropes; tropes that are drenched in understanding, and which are used in a story to give over a certain  meaning . Simply using a trope instantly places that event within the narrative, and conjures up a whole bunch of associations that an audience can use to  understand  that event - to the benefit of the speaker. \\n Turning an event into a story isn\\'t necessarily a bad thing. It is difficult to imagine how World War Two could be talked about if it weren\\'t structured in this way; without providing some sort of framework for understanding then millions of voices, situations, and experiences would be jumbled together without any ability to structure it by time or theme. It would be chaos - and thus meaningless. And so we wouldn\\'t  be able  talk about it. \\n TL;DR World War Two is one of the grandest historical stories English-speaking societies have. It is used in a way which promotes certain understandings - the black-and-white nature of the traditional narrative reflects that. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Yes, certainly...sorry to hijack your thread, OP!  Firstly, I should have said this more clearly.  What I was trying to say to the original commenter is that Latin American independence was very different from the independence of the United States (I see that on AskHistorians from time to time).  Certainly discontent among the upper classes in Latin America has been well documented as a growing disconnect between creoles and peninsulares.  That was the dominant discourse in independence historiography for much of the 70s and 80s, which in turn was a response to the nationalistic understanding of independence that arose before that.  Classic literature from this generation of scholars includes historians like Tulio Halperín-Donghi on the ruptures of a creole elite in Argentina; Simon Collier on the breakdown of Chilean elite; and Fernando Novais on the degradation of the mercantilist system and its connection to the destruction of elite Brazilian society.  Ultimately, what these historians argue is that the elite broke down into the familiar “creole vs. peninsulares” conflict.  The creoles seized the momentum during Napoleon’s invasion, but their movement broke down a second time during the subsequent civil wars.  All of this eventually culminated in the creation of new nation-states with creoles at the helm. \\n While this isn’t incorrect, recent studies have added sociocultural developments to this narrative, which gets at your question of popular participation.  For example, Jaime Rodríguez in his book  The Independence of Spanish America  called the revolution a civil war between Spaniards.  This cast the empire as more of a heterogeneous confederation that couldn’t stay together without the king as its head.  This argument rejected the idea that independence had to happen or was somehow inevitable. \\n Other historians have examined “alternative movements” that occurred during the revolutions or subsequent civil wars.  One notable movement from the Río de la Plata is José Artigas, who challenged Buenos Aires for hegemony in the region in the mid 1810s by forming the  liga de los pueblos libres  (League of Free People or Pueblos depending on how you translate it).  He mobilized large numbers of common people to resist Spain, Portugal, and the elites of Buenos Aires in the Banda Oriental.  The most famous book on the subject is the older  Artigas y su revolución agraria, 1811-1820  by Sala de Touron, Torre, and Rodríguez.  Ariel de la Fuente’s book  The Children of Facundo  also casts caudillo and gaucho movements of the post-revolutionary period as popular participation that shaped the outcome of the revolution.  Other “alternative movements” include indigenous Andean rebellions and Father Hidalgo in Mexico. \\n Another vein examines the precedent set in traditional Spanish law and citizenship.  Here, I recommend Chiaramonte’s books  Ciudades, Provincias, Estados: Orígenes de la Nación Argentina (1800-1846)  and  Nation and State in Latin America: Political Language During Independence .  His article in  Hispanic American Historical Review  “The ‘Ancient Constitution’ after Independence (1808-1852)” is also quite interesting.  His works become increasingly abstract, which I think pulls away somewhat from the pragmatic issues at hand during the revolutions themselves but still provide valuable nuance.  Other articles you might want to examine are “Imperio, constitución y diversidad en la América hispana” by Antonio Annino; “Our Pueblos, Factions with No Central Unity” by Jordana Dym; “Constitutional Theory and Political Reality: Liberalism, Traditionalism, and the Spanish Cortes, 1810-1814” by Brian Hamnett; and “The Colored Castes and American Representation in the Cortes of Cádiz” by James King.  Additionally, Hilda Sabato recently published a review of the historiography on citizenship in the  American Historical Review  (“On Political Citizenship in Nineteenth-Century Latin America”).  Finally, recent works have also examined loyalist perceptions of the revolution.  For example Christon Archer’s essay “The Army of New Spain and the Wars of Independence, 1790-1821” and John Fischer’s “The Royalist Regime in the Viceroyalty of Peru 1820-1824” both demonstrate the fragmentation of the loyalist side.  This is key because it helps us better understand how much negotiation and debate was going on throughout the independence and national periods. \\n In essence, the recent historiography has contextualized the “creole vs. peninsulares” conflict and indeed the revolution itself into a larger image of change within the late colonial Spanish Empire.  The revolution itself stretched on for decades within this context of negotiation, debate, and transformation that included people from all walks of life on both sides of the Atlantic. \\n Fair warning though if you’re going to look into these works: They often get quite abstract and dense.  It is specialist literature, which can make it hard for the layman to dive into.  I think it’s easier to keep track of everything if you contextualize individual works within the reexamination of independence and state-formation. \\n TL;DR: Yes, creoles precipitated and led the revolution, but there were a whole bunch of other forces that shaped the course and results of the independence period.  Historians have recently been deepening our understanding of why the revolutions occurred and why they played out the way they did. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Since all the other comments have been deleted maybe I can try my hand: \\n The long and short of it is that any count of won/lost battles and wars would vary greatly based on how they\\'re counted. If we look at Rome, for example. Are the three Punic Wars three wars or one? What about the Arab Wars between the Muslim Caliphate and the Roman Empire; how many wars were they? Do we count skirmishes during interbellum periods between wars as separate wars? Even battles have problems with how they could be counted. Many times the victor of a battle is uncertain. Napoleon\\'s War/Wars are a great example of how arbitrary any count of won/lost wars/battles would be. How many \"Napoleonic Wars\" were there: one (from his rise to his death), two (from his rise to his capture and then from his escape to Waterloo), or more (his early Italian campaigns to his being crowned Emperor, his early wars to his capture, etc.)? Do his Russian campaigns count as a separate war? Does each time a small force of Russian raiders harried the retreating French force count as a whole battle? Even more problematic, where does France begin? Does the count of France\\'s battles restart after the French Revolution? Do we start counting the victories of Frankish kings while part of France was still Roman Gaul? \\n So, while it\\'s impossible to address the question directly, there is an implicit statement being made here. Modern viewers often view France as a paper tiger (this results from the beating it took during WWII). The statement posed in the original question is highlighting the fact that it isn\\'t. That part is true. The best piece of evidence that I can put forward to redeem France\\'s reputation is the fact that following Napoleon, France was considered so powerful that it took the combined weight of Austria, Britain, Prussia, and Russia to create a security arrangement that was considered to have put them at a parity with France ( Sorry for the paywall. The article is also available on JSTOR, I think but I don\\'t have access.). This is not to say that all of those powers couldn\\'t have destroyed France if they wanted to join forces, rather that to create a stable balance of power, it took all of those states acting consciously and in concert to counteract France. There are other examples of French military acumen but I think that\\'s the best. \\n The area that comprises France is rich and populous and has been for quite some time. The states/kingdoms/republics/empires (whether you count them as one continuity or not) that have occupied that space have been able to draw on those resources to their advantage in war (There is a reason that French was the common language, or lingua Franca if you\\'ll pardon the play on words, of Europe; look at Peter Rickhard\\'s  A History of the French Language  for more.). That\\'s really the most blanket statement you can make to that effect. Going over each war and battle to create an arbitrary count would be missing the point. \\n TLDR: It\\'s impossible to count how many battles a country has won or lost in the long term. Even so, France was pretty bad ass for a while. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"The disaster of Manzikert lied not with the battle in of itself but in the events that followed. The direct consequence of the battle was that for the first time since Valerian that a Roman/Byzantine emperor had been captured by an enemy power. \\n Now, it had not been Alp Alsan's intention to become involved in an extended war with Byzantium given that the Seljuk Turks' principal enemy were the Shia Fatimids of Egypt (The Turks had in the recent past become Sunnii and fundamentally opposed to the Shia). Thus, Alp released Romanos IV on the conditions that he would pay the Seljuks 1.5 million nomistia (gold coins) and another 360,000 nomistia annually. \\n The real issue that made Manzikert such a pivotal point in Byzantine and Turkish history was that Romanos' hold on the throne was had shaky from the start given that he had come to power essentially by marrying the widow of the previous emperor Constantine X Doukas. This act do not endear Romanos to the Doukas family, who used the fact that Romanos had been humiliated by the Seljuk Sultan to dispose of him and install Michael VII Doukas as emperor instead. \\n However, Constantine was a weak emperor who set off a chain reaction where in the imperial throne was viewed as being up for graps and generals abandoned the outer defenses of the empire to stake their claim on the throne. All the while, the main reason Romanos had instigated the Manzikert campaign in the beginning was to put an end to Turkoman raids coming from the east. While the Seljuks had little interest in the Byzantines, this did not stop still nomadic bands of Turks called Turkomen from invading Armenia and Cappadocia.  Given that these areas were under the control of Byzantium and that the emperor had a responsibility to protect his empire and that defeating the Turks would help to stabilize his hold on power, There is little wonder that Romanos decided to undertake his campaign. \\n However, with the emperor defeated and the command structure fighting amongst itself, this provided the Turkomen a golden opportunity to enter the empire nearly unopposed and settle in a land similar to their Central Asian homeland. In a move reminiscent to how the Western Roman Empire had used Germanic tribes in its wars, many Byzantine generals started using the Turks, a provilent case being one Suleyman ibn Kutalamis who had aligned himself with the Governor of the Anatolic Theme (Providence) against Michael VII. The Governor was ultimately defeated but Suleyman took over the city of Nicea, which would be the first capital of what would be the Sultanate of Rum (Rum means Rome in Turkish and refers to the fact that the Byzantines still referred to themselves as Romans and their Empire as the Roman Empire). \\n It also be mentioned that the Turks were not the only people the Byzantines had to concern themselves with. In addition to conquering England , the Normans also conquered Sicily and Southern Italy from both the Arabs and the Byzantines, ending with the fall of Byzantine Bari in 1071. The Normans also served as mercenaries to the Byzantine generals and one Norman, Roussel de Balliou attempted to establish for himself an independent state in Anatolia before being defeated by the Byzantines. \\n The crisis brought on by Manzikert only started to come to end in end with the proclamation of Alexis Comnenos in 1081. He quickly married Irene Douka and appointed Constantine Douka, the son of Michael VII as co-emperor, putting an end to the civil war. However, Alexis's primary concern at the beginning of his reign wasn't the Turks but the Normans under Robert Guiscard, who saw that Alexis was a usurper and desired the throne for himself.  Likely for Alexis, Guiscard's plans fell apart as a storm in 1081 and a epidemic in 1082 decimated Guiscard's forces. Regardless, Guiscard did make Alexis neglect Anatolia, as Alexis essentially kept Suleyman in power until he was killed in 1086 near Antioch. However, what Suleyman had started to form in Anatolia passed on to Kilij Arslan, who set his base in Nicaea after moving away from the collapsing Great Seljuk Empire  that had defeated Romanos IV. It was that this point that Alexis sent a fateful letter to Pope Urban II for military aid that would set off the Crusades and ultimately seal the fate of the Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire. \\n TL;DR: Romanos IV's capture and release set off a civil war in which the Turks both participated in and took advantage of which occurred alongside Norman aggression, which was considered a greater threat to the empire. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('Well, there are two words/stems meaning ‘Gaul’: Γαλατία (*Γαλατ-) and Γαλλία, the former being the much more common form and attested as early as the late 4th century B.C. by Timaeus of Tauromenium (FGrH 566F, fr. 69), who says the name was derived from Γαλάτης, the mythical son of Polyphemus and the sea-nymph Galateia. \\n By contrast, most testimonies for Γαλλία are fairly late; once in Strabo (Cap. 1.4.1), who otherwise uses Γαλατία, Claudius Ptolemaeus uses both forms, Cassius Dio uses both but vastly prefers Γαλατία, Flavius Josephus uses both; Plutarch, Polybius and Diodorus Siculus use Γαλατία exclusively. \\n Among the Christian writers (Eusebius, Epiphanius, Athanasius), Γαλλία seems to become a bit more common, though without superseding Γαλατία.

For example, the prejudices of a source may point to a strong sentiment among a certain population.  The use of metaphysical explanations for events points to the prominence of religious hegemony or social structure. \\n Quite opposite to legal standards, in history, eyewitnesses are probably one of the most useful and reliable sources.  Why?  Because in history, unlike law, we are looking just as much as historical society and views, than the event/person in question, and any inaccuracies can be used to help further this understanding. \\n So, for the TL;DR version.  Even if ancient sources are unreliable, they can still be used for valuable information about other topics (i.e. prejudices).

However the economic groundwork that enabled the mass production of tanks, planes, bullets, and guns developed as a result of World War One, when the U.S. was shipping Britain and it's allies supplies and weapons with little to no danger to itself. \\n The roaring twenties, brought about by the victory, flood of investment, and mechanization, also helped boost that economic dominance and continue to lay the groundwork for the massive factories and production that could be changed over for war-time use. \\n Since you might be wondering about the depression, it acted as more of an economic freeze than anything - all the factories were still there, with (almost) all the necessary equipment, give or take a few retooling efforts. It was just a matter of having a state-mandated workforce mobilization for production to begin on a mass scale. \\n As someone else noted, this production on the North American continent was far away from the fighting in Europe and Asia, leaving our workforce, and production in tact at the end of the war. This was incredibly important, because of rationing of supplies, and government-mandated weapons manufacture, few consumer goods were available while women in the factories, and men overseas, compiled wages. Come 1946 when production shifted back over, there was another economic boom as people all bought new durable goods, and spent their money on lavish lifestyles - basking in simply being American. All of this was protected by a capable navy, which grew in size due to the new Air Craft Carrier production, and was already mostly established on the basis of Roosevelt's Great White Fleet, and protected domestic interests on both Oceans, permanently replacing England for dominance of the waves. \\n TL;DR: All the pieces were already there, it just took World War Two to put everything together cohesively. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"You should go to university, take your intro courses in Physics and History, then see which you like better.

Engineering is both easier, and has better job opportunities than Physics short of a phd, even then it is select fields. History and Physics have very different job opportunities though. Physics you are doing more analytical work like engineering, design and and analysis.

Naturally, the Byzantines were not happy about this turn of events; Greek Orthodoxy continued to hold some sway in Hungary, but was largely gone by the 1100's. \\n However, since Hungary was the buffer state between the Byzantine Empire and the Holy Roman Empire, both countries tried to conquer the kingdom multiple times (HRE in the 1040s and Byzantines in the 1070s), with the Hungarian rulers subsequently siding with the other side in turn. \\n The situation normalised in the 1090s, when Hungarian king I.(Saint) Ladislaus married her daughter, Piroska to Byzantine Emperor-to-be, Iannos Komnenos. Piroska was re-babtised as Ierene, and became a saint of the Orthodox Church later; this marked a period of rising Byzantine influence in Hungary. \\n This reached it's climax during the reign of Béla III, who, as a second son of King Géza II, was married to the Byzantine princess in 1163, and in a quick turn of events, was formally named the heir of Manuel I of the Byzantine Empire in 1165 (the title despot was created specially for him). However, Manuel later had a son, and Béla's elder brother died childless - making him instead the new king of Hungary in 1172. \\n From 1172 to 1180 (until Manuel's death), Hungary and the Byzantine Empire were close allies. During this time, Béla managed to recover the territories lost to the Byzantine Empire by his father (Dalmatia, which was probably more often conquered and re-conquered than Alsace), and later successfully defended Zara from the Venetians.\\nDuring the Fourth Crusade, Hungary itself was threatened by the Crusader armies (that is, Venice) in Zara, so they were at least somewhat sympathetic to the Byzantine cause. \\n \\n TL,DR: Hungarian-Byzantine relations were quite bad in the 10th and 11th century, but excellent in the 12th due to marriages. Hungarian items of the age (eg. the crown's lower part) provide proofs about the close Byzantine-Hungarian relations. \\n Edit: enters \\n\",\n  0),\n ('I\\'m posting well outside my specialism here, and more as a politics enthusiast than a historian. But I\\'ll try to keep it objective. \\n The start of it, I suppose, is simply that Thatcher like all high-profile politicians was divisive: at the time, her political supporters (conservatives) loved her and her political opponents (the left) hated her. But it\\'s certainly true that the intensity of feeling on both sides has proven to be much more lasting than the average Prime Minister\\'s, on a par with Churchill or Atlee. I was born six months before she left office, but being from a northern industrial town was brought up on the idea that she was (with only slight exaggeration) the embodiment of evil. She was awarded the [highest honour in the UK]( and is regularly cited as one of our greatest Prime Ministers, but there have been [street parties planned in advance for the day of her death]( for years. \\n I can think of three factors that have amplified that run-of-the-mill divisiveness into the hero-queen slash boogeywoman she is today. First is that Thatcher is almost universally considered to be a \"great\"—in the sense that she had a massive impact—Prime Minister. It\\'s common to divide postwar British political history into two \\'consensuses\\': the postwar consensus and the Thatcherite consensus. That is, even though the Conservatives were in power more often, between 1945 and 1979 the national political agenda was very much defined by the groundbreaking policies Clement Atlee\\'s postwar Labour government (the welfare state, nationalisation, etc). Thatcher\\'s is seen as the first government to fundamentally break with that consensus, and in doing so created a new one of her own. Governments since then, even Labour ones, are seen as working in the mould Thatcher created. That sense that she was really doing something radically—not just presiding over business as usual—made her premiership unusually divisive at the time and guaranteed that she\\'d continue to be discussed for years to come (unlike, say, Major). \\n Second is that she was in power—very firmly in power—for a long time (11 years, then another 7 under her protege Major). Throughout the 60s and 70s people got used to alternating between Tory and Labour fairly regularly, and at first it looked like Thatcher was just a continuation of that trend, but after her first term she\\'d established herself as something different, defeating Labour in the worst election in the history of the party and getting the mandate to embark on her more radical program of reform. Labour slowly morphed from a government-in-waiting to an increasingly desperate opposition and as its senior cadre with government experience shrunk it became increasingly radical. By the end of the 70s the left was in a poor state; Thatcher seemed like an immovable object and as a result one generally didn\\'t get into left wing politics with the hope of actually doing something – your job was criticising Thatcher. \\n Third, and from my admittedly biased perspective most importantly, Thatcher\\'s policies had a very palpable and direct influence on a great many lives. Every head of government has bright eyed activists that think they\\'re the devil, but usually they move on once they\\'re out of office. But Thatcher didn\\'t just put up/down taxes or fight unpopular wars, she\\'s blamed for destroying the economic basis of whole communities.  That  is something you remember 20 years later and pass on to your children and your grandchildren. Her economic reforms were seen as creating a long period of high unemployment and increased inequality which disproportionately affected industrial towns. Privatisation lead to immediate, highly visible effects on the everyday cost of living (energy bills, public transport costs, etc) while her welfare reforms cut the income of many. Throughout her premiership she was perceived as attacking the pillars of working class political identity: industry, the unions, social housing and social security, you name it. After the fact, these could all be conveniently boiled down into evocative soundbites explaining the difficulties facing post-industrial working class communities. No jobs? Thatcher shut them down. No council houses? Thatcher sold them. Have to pay for your kids\\' school milk? \"Thatcher Thatcher, the milk bottle snatcher...\" \\n So  tl;dr : she was one of most important Prime Ministers of the twentieth century, who sidelined her political opponents so effectively they retreated into ever more strident criticism, and her policies brought lasting hardship a shrinking but significant section of the British populace. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Some numbers from UK general elections may also help in better understanding Margret Thatchers\\' popularity. \\n In the UK a government is generally formed by a party (or parties) that is able to command the majority of members of parliament (MPs). MPs represent a parliamentary constituency, all are up for election in a general election, and they are elected on a first past the post basis. This means that there can be quite a wide discrepancy between a party\\'s share of the popular vote and the number of MPs elected to parliament. \\n [This table gives a handy breakdown of popular vote and number of seats for UK general elections since 1945.]( \\n When Thatcher came to power in 1979 the Conservatives won 43.9% of the vote and commanded 53.4% of seats in parliament. \\n In the landslide of 1983 the Conservative share of the vote dropped to 42.4% yet they had a crushing 61.1% of seats. This was largely due to the collapse of the Labour party and the rise of SDP (formed by ex Labour politicians) / Liberal alliance. \\n In her last election in 1987 the Conservative share dropped further to 42.4% and the parliamentary majority was 57.7% of seats. \\n You cannot directly link popular support to share of the popular vote. Elections for MPs have a strong personal and local element, the large national parties don\\'t contest in Northern Ireland, and there is a certain amount of (hard to quantify) tactical voting by some voters (where their preferred party has no chance in a constituency so they vote for another.) Only the voters of Finchley (Thatcher\\'s parliamentary constituency) ever had the chance to directly cast a vote for or against her. \\n It is also worth noting that turnout in these elections varied from 76%-72.7% of registered voters. And.. not all those qualified to register to vote actually register, although I\\'m not sure of the numbers on this. \\n The parliamentary majorities enjoyed by the Conservatives, especially after the 1983 and 1987 landslides meant that Thatcher was in a very powerful position to pass legislation and enact policy. Rebellion my members of the ruling party is a major constraining effect on British governments and large majorities make this much less likely. So while Thatcher was indeed a strong willed person, averse to compromise, she was also in a very strong position domestically and was able to project this power abroad (hence the Iron Lady image). \\n TLDR: much of the power of \"strong\" Thatcher derives from amplification effects of the UK parliamentary system combined with the implosion of the Labour party in the early 80s. It doesn\\'t scale with electoral support (which is itself an inaccurate approximation of personal support). In all elections where she ran as party leader more people voted for other parties than for the Conservative party. \\n EDIT: typos \\n EDIT2: corrected Margret Thatchers\\' constituency \\n',\n  0),\n ('Stalin micro\\'d to an insane degree, but the difference between him and Hitler was that, Stalin thought, and acted like the Supreme Warlord that he was, while Hitler acted like a corporal suddenly promoted to a General. \\n Stalin\\'s hand was on every single plan, even the concept of a \"Stavka representative\" at every front was to ensure control.

From the 15th until the 18th century the Ottoman Empire was arguably the most powerful polity in the world (with the possible exception of China), at its height controlling everything between Vienna (which it sieged twice but never captured) and the Persian Gulf, and it subsequent domination of land and sea trade routes through the region brought it fabulous wealth and grandeur. \\n However, the Ottoman Empire never had access to the resource that would bring about its downfall: transoceanic colonial empires. As Britain, France and the Netherlands especially began establishing footholds in the Indian ocean and East Asia, the writing on the walls became clearer. The Ottoman Empire\\'s vital trade positioning at the crossroads of East and West was simply being sailed-around. Throughout the 19th Century the empire went into steady decline, being known as the \"Sick Man of Europe\", and one by one its far-flung territories gained effective or complete independence. \\n The final nail in the coffin, of course, was the First World War, after which the Empire ended and Britain and France carved up its many regions into mandates and protectorates, causing the same problems we see in Africa: borders were drawn with little regard for ethnic, religious, or linguistic lines, creating problems such as the Kurds being divided between several different countries, or Iraq lumping together 3 major ethno-religious groups. \\n Since then a few major factors have dominated the Middle East: first, the Israel/Palestine question which is easily combined with Cold War politics has made the formation of a large Unified Muslim state impossible - Turkey and the Shah of Iran were backed by the US, and Saudi Arabia is usually in the US camp (except on questions of Israel/Palestine) whereas Egypt attempted to maintain Neutrality and the other Arab states were supported by the USSR. Second, the rise of Oil might seem like a source of power for a growing Muslim superstate (Saudi Arabia would qualify, to an extent), but as the Gulf War demonstrates Oil wealth can be a source of contention. Oil, especially in areas without other major industries, notoriously often causes economic decline except for an accumulation of wealth in the hands of the land owners/rulers (known as the \"resource curse\"). Third, the 1979 Iranian Revolution brought reactionary and aggressive Shi\\'a rulers to power in Iran, causing massive instability in the region (see Iran/Iraq war and Iranian support of Hezbollah). \\n TL;DR  - The Muslim world has only had 95 years since its last great empire, cut them a little slack! \\n Sources \\n Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World  - Jack Weatherford \\n A History of the Arab Peoples  - Albert Hourani \\n',\n  0),\n ('I can\\'t speak on behalf of all dynasties and their capitals but most often in the case of Beijing it is because the emperor or dictator at the time often has base of power in the north. \\n The Mongol Yuan dynasty was the first to make Beijing their capital, which makes sense as they first invaded the northern Jurchen Jin dynasty, taking their capital before invading the southern Song. When the Ming overthrew the Mongols they reverted back to the traditional capital of Nanjing only to switch back to Beijing. So why the change? \\n The first Ming emperor moved the capital south, closer to its Chinese roots and gave his son Beijing, the former capital. When his son took the throne as emperor Yongle (after a bloody coup) he reverted it back to Beijing. His justification is that it is closer to the northern front, making it easier to respond to future \"barbarian invasions.\" While this reasoning is true, it is also likely his intentions were that he wanted to move the capital to his power base (since he had been holding Beijing on behalf of his father for up till his ascension). \\n When the Ming fell to the Qing, the capital of Beijing once again fell to northern invaders. The Manchu of the Qing made Beijing their capital while subduing southern China. Once again the capital was closer to their source of power (in this case Manchuria). \\n The Qing fell to the republic and the new democratic revolutionaries moved the capital again to Nanjing, the more historic and central capital. However soon after Sun Yat-sen was made president he was forced to give up his presidency to the most powerful General in China, Yuan Shikai. Yuan Shikai was the general of the North China army (Beiyang army), so naturally one of his acts as presidents was move the capital to the northern capital, and away from the power base of his political opponents, the KMT. \\n Eventually the KMT under Chiang Kai-shek would take power, moving the capital back to southern Nanjing (also worth noting that the KMT military wing had its origins in the south as well). As the focus of my study is pre-modern China I can only suspect in the case of the communists; I am open for correction. Though I suspect that when the communists fought the KMT they once again followed the pattern of a power base in the north. The Communists had a strong presence in north China since the long march and in Manchuria since the Japanese withdrawal. Also, the northern capital would put them closer to the USSR, nominally and ally and tactically a threat. \\n TL;DR: capitals move depending on the origin of the dynasty or emperor to where he has most power \\n',\n  0),\n ('In the 11th and 12th centuries, Slavic settlements appeared in Cuman lands in Southern Ukraine. The Cumans are a nomadic Turkic tribe that occupied Southern Ukraine, large parts of Romania, and the steppes of what is now Southern Russia and Northern Kazakhstan. The Slavic settlers were influenced by the Cumans. \\n There was large amounts of intermarriage between the two groups, allowing the Slavic settlers to learn new ways of warfare from the Cumans, such as steppe horsemanship. However, they retained their Orthodox religion and Ukrainian language. The Turkic influence can be seen in the name Cossack, derived from the Cuman  Cosac  or freeman. \\n In the 13th and 14th centuries, the Slavic settlements increased in size and organization, such that by the 15th century, they were a loosely organized set of villages that fielded local armies. Later, they merged into two main hosts, or states- The Zaporozhian Host was in the west, while the Don River Host was in the east. Other small hosts existed, but these two were the main ones. \\n On the steppes, much had changed during this time period. Tatars, a tribe in the Mongol confederation, had replaced the Cumans on the steppes. The Tatars frequently raided Poland, Lithuania, and the Russian states, and were a major nuisance to the states in Eastern Europe. \\n It is in this time that the Cossacks became known for their military skill.  Historically, the Cossacks derived much of their wealth from robbing their neighbors. As such, they developed sophisticated settlement organizations to better rob their neighbors and to fight back if the neighbors seek revenge. \\n For their organization, the Zaporozhian Host is a good example. Villages were organized into districts under democratically elected military leadership, with a central council- the democratically elected Sich Rada, that decided on the law of the land. With military organization down to the villages, raids were easy to organize and to counter. \\n The Cossacks frequently raided the Tatars for loot. Given their Christian, Slavic culture, they were looked upon by Poland and Muscovy as allies against the raids of the Tatars and their Turkish overlords. Poland gave weapons and funds to the Zaporozhians in exchange for defending Poland\\'s southern border. The Don Cossacks were encouraged to raid the Turks as well. \\n For their part, the Cossacks were more than happy to raid everyone equally. However, the Zaporozhians became Polish vassals, while the Don Cossacks became Russian vassals, receiving weapons and funds on condition of military service. This made their raids on their fellow Slavs much less frequent than on the Tatars. \\n Cossack arms spearheaded the Russian conquest of Tatar lands in Ukrane and Persian/Turkish holdings in the Caucasus. Even Siberia was captured by Cossacks, who explored and conquered the frontier. The Cossacks were also talented seamen, who launched raids on the heartland of Turkey itself, even looting the outskirts of Constantinople. \\n Much of the Romanticism about the Cossacks comes from their wars with the \"heathen\" Turks and Tatars. Their democratic organization was the joy of liberals and philosophers, while Cossack raids made them well-known as formidable fighters throughout Europe. \\n tl;dr  Cossacks have a good track record in warfare. \\n',\n  0),\n ('So this is probably the biggest or 2nd biggest topic of study for political scientists specializing in Japan (primarily because of the \\'93/\\'94 Electoral Reforms which resulted from this brief period of opposition government) meaning I won\\'t be able to give a fully comprehensive answer, but I\\'ll try to keep it concise and related to your specific questions just so the answer doesn\\'t get too bloated. BUT I say all that just to say there is a ton more to learn on this topic! If you\\'re interested maybe check out any of the books listed in my sources as they\\'re actually pretty quick reads, but very information dense. \\n In any event, as you noted in your question the LDP \\'lost\\' in 1993, but this loss was not as definitive as it may seem on the surface. The LDP did not \\'lose the election\\' they simply did not win enough seats to form a government without a coalition. This is an important distinction when questioning why the LDP came back into power so quickly, because it elucidates the fact that the LDP was STILL by a wide margin the most popular political party in Japan even during those brief few months when they were out of power. The LDP held 43% of the seats in parliament even after this election and the next closest individual part held only 13% (The Japan Socialist Party, the LDP\\'s longtime rivals). \\n The reason for the LDP\\'s drop in popularity at this particular moment was multifaceted but scholars generally single out two major causes. The first is that the LDP\\'s longtime consensus of economic prosperity began to crack with the bursting of Japan\\'s Asset Price Bubble. Previously Japan\\'s ever growing economy had allowed the LDP to mobilize political pork to strategically purchase votes necessary to staying in power (largely pulled from agrarian districts) while pacifying potentially hostile urban voters with overall economic success in the country (Even if these voters did not like the LDP, they could not deny that the LDP and the Bureaucrats allied to them continued to increase Japan\\'s GDP, resulting in higher wages and standards of living for all Japanese citizens). SO when the bubble burst and the LDP could no longer pacify opponents with economic success, these hostile voters became more likely to mobilize against them. \\n The second major factor to the LDP\\'s brief loss of power was widespread scandal shaking the public\\'s faith in the LDP and their bureaucratic allies. Because of Japan\\'s unique electoral system (Single Non-Transferable Vote, Multi-Member District) and because the LDP was so reliant on political pork to continue its uninterrupted dominance, LDP politicians were incredibly prone to accepting illegal funds from large corporations. LDP politicians needed money to buy votes and big businesses wanted government assistance from the LDP and the bureaucracy in the form of protectionism etc (This, along with the farm subsidies used to lure the agrarian vote into the LDP\\'s camp made up Japan\\'s so called \\'steel and rice\\' coalition, named after Bismarck\\'s \\'Iron and Rye\\'). \\n In any event, because of the inherent corruption of this system, it was only a matter of time before the alliance collapsed. A series of scandals (most notably the Recruit Scandal [an insider trading scam] which involved multiple LDP politicians and the Sagawa Kyubin corruption scandal [where Japanese politician Kanemaru Shin accepted outright bribes from Japanese construction companies which he used to purchase hundreds of pounds of gold which he hoarded under the floorboards in his home and which was later found by authorities searching the residence]) where high ranking LDP party members played major roles resulted in massive loss of prestige in the eyes of the Japanese populace. Moreover, similar scandals resulted in a total loss of confidence in the Japanese bureaucracy [which beforehand was considered the most prestigious and effective group in Japan]. Much like the political scandals these were incredibly numerous but for the sake of brevity I\\'ll only list one of the two most extreme examples. The Ministry of Health and Welfare had allowed HIV infected blood to be put into Japanese blood banks and subsequently used in the treating of patients (specifically hemophiliacs). Many of these patients (total number of infected was somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000) died shortly thereafter. The Ministry of Health and Welfare had neglected screening procedures for the blood because some MoHW officials had received payments from Japanese companies which hoped to have their blood used in Japanese clinics rather than imported competitor product. \\n Also important to note is that the previously mentioned \\'bubble bursting\\' was blamed on the Ministry of Finance. Many officials within the MoF neglected oversight procedures intended to keep banks from making dangerous loans. This lack of oversight destabilized the Japanese financial system, drastically exacerbating the eventual collapse. While the human cost was not present in this scandal, it served to further erode the peoples\\' confidence in the Japanese bureaucracy. \\n The LDP and the various bureaucratic ministries had been linked through the \\'55 System (the period of uninterrupted LDP rule). As such, when both of these institutions fell prey to scandals, the Japanese people lost all confidence in them and called for their removal. The various opposition parties used this moment of weakness for the LDP to rail against the party and the bureaucracy. They promised the people they would remove the corrupt LDP from power and take power away from the bureaucrats who were now seen as corrupt, incompetent, and disconnected from the peoples\\' well being. \\n Moreover, several high ranking LDP members (most notably Ozawa Ichiro nicknamed \"the Destroyer\" for his role in the LDP\\'s \\'93 downfall among other things) saw this as an opportunity to leap off a sinking ship. The left the LDP to form small independent parties, calling for reform. So in addition to loss of face publicly and a reinvigorated opposition the LDP also had to deal with internal dissension in 1993. \\n However, in spite of all this, the LDP was still very much the most popular and most powerful party in Japan at this time. The opposition seized this opportunity of LDP weakness to form and unwieldy and unstable 7 party coalition which managed to form a government and keep the LDP out of power.  However, the key phrase there was \"unstable.\" The only thing the 7 parties agreed on was that they hated the LDP and that they wanted to enact electoral reform in order to prevent LDP resurgence. Unfortunately for them, none of the parties could agree on what type of new electoral system would be best for Japan (and for themselves). The small parties wanted Proportional Representation and a party list, the large parties wanted Single Member Districts, and as a result of these disagreements this coalition government got very little done. They DID manage to enact electoral reform, but could accomplish nothing else which the Japanese people saw as worthwhile, and as a result lost the peoples\\' confidence. Then in 1994 the coalition splintered and the LDP was able to form its own coalition government with some of the more marginalized smaller parties (namely the Komeito, Clean Government Party, a party affiliated with Soka Gakkai, a lay Buddhist group) and retake power. Moreover, they also were able to reincorporate many of the defectors who had left the party in the reform euphoria. \\n Things get even crazier after that, but I feel like I\\'ve already written too much so I\\'ll just leave it there haha. Hope that was helpful. \\n TL:DR - Scandals removed the LDP\\'s long held majority as voters lost faith in the LDP and their bureaucratic allies. However, the coalition which replaced it was very unstable and quickly fell apart due to infighting. This allowed the LDP (which had never even fallen below 43% of the members of parliament anyway and had remained the largest party in Japan) to form its own coalition government and thus quickly regain power. \\n Sources: \\n Japan Transformed - Frances McCall Rosenbluth and Michael F.

The short answer is \"it\\'s complicated.\" \\n I did graduate work on newspapers in Missouri after the war (I was looking at the later-applied notions of professionalism and objectivity and how those applied or did not apply to actual papers in the period 1867-1890). As a result of that, I learned a fair amount about the civil war in Missouri, which I will use to illustrate how complicated this question is to answer. (Missouri is not the best example of this from a national perspective, because in the 1850s the state was a border state engaged in a running guerrilla war with Kansas, but its status as a border state also serves to illustrate how competing ideologies clashed and mixed during this period. Also, I know something about it.) \\n So, in the 1850s, Missouri was like many areas on the North-South border in that it was being rapidly transformed by the spreading market economy. Many Missourians could be described as free white yeoman farmers, but there was a large and growing urban population in St. Louis, and the city was burgeoning as a center of commerce. Slavery was a marginal presence in most counties and a major presence in some (notably along the Missouri and Mississippi river bottoms). At the time, most farms operated on a barter economy but cash was being increasingly used for transactions, and farmers were aware that their products were in the midst of a transition from mostly local use to being sold abroad in the wider market. This transition is important to understanding attitudes towards slavery. \\n Most whites in the state in 1850 were from Southern states (approximately 75 percent), and others who had emigrated from Ohio, Indiana and Illinois had come from areas that had previously been settled by Southerners. There was also a growing German population in the state, mostly in St. Louis but also in some river towns; as well as a large Irish population, mostly in St. Louis. (The German and Irish population in St. Louis made it the American city with the largest percentage of foreign-born population in 1860,  with close to 60%. Also, many of those immigrants were engaged in industrial labor, which was concentrated in St. Louis.) The railroad reached St. Louis in 1853, and served to integrate products (which could be shipped by river to the city) from Missouri\\'s hinterland to the wider economy in the East. \\n The African-American population in Missouri had risen substantially since 1810, but fallen steadily as a percentage of population since 1830, when African-Americans (free and slave) had made up almost 18 percent of the population. By 1850, there were about 3,500 free African-Americans in the state and 115,000 slaves, comprising slightly less than 10 percent of the state\\'s population. We don\\'t know as much as we would like to about attitudes among that group in the 1850s, but I think I am safe in assuming that they were generally antislavery Unionists. \\n The slave owners in Missouri (who were always a minority of whites) settled along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, growing mostly hemp and tobacco (cotton was never a large crop in the state). Hemp would be made into fiber and sent South for bagging and binding cotton bales, and tobacco sold in the wider market throughout the U.S. Most slave owners in Missouri owned few slaves; the average number per slave owner was 4.66, and only about 20 families owned more than 50 slaves. Only about 12.5 percent of white families owned slaves, compared with close to 50% in the lower South. \\n The hemp market illustrates the complexity of attitudes towards slavery, and how people felt towards either North or South. Missouri\\'s hemp crop was grown mostly with slave labor, and sold South, but strong tariffs on imported hemp (opposed by free-trade Southerners) made hemp growers sympathetic to the North, and thus reluctant Unionists. These slave counties were also surrounded by free states, and a large swath of the state north and south of the Missouri River that had very few to no slaves at all. The southern counties in particular (in the Missouri Ozarks) were full of poor whites who hated both African-Americans and planters (it was quite possible to be pro-slavery and anti-African-American; Irish attitudes were similar -- by marginalizing slaves, the Irish sought to carve out a higher status that might eventually accord them equal rights with natives.) \\n The German immigrants, many of whom were refugees from the revolutions of 1848, were the majority of the only strong anti-slavery groups in the state. \\n In fact, most people who voted in Missouri (said group obviously not including slaves) supported compromise with the South. The presidential election of 1860 illustrates this: the river counties that were intensively slaveholding counties voted for John Bell and Stephen A. Douglas, while the poorest white counties were those that voted for John C. Breckenridge. The German population voted overwhelmingly for Lincoln; in fact, he garnered ~17,000 votes in Missouri, which was a majority of the 27,000 votes he got from  all slave states . \\n So, prior to 1861, politics in Missouri had not been unusually turbulent. The \"Boonslick Democrats\" who dominated the state legislature were people who came from the river counties and had an interest in preserving slavery, but who (cynically or otherwise) presented themselves as Unionists and downplayed slavery to succeed in an overwhelmingly non-slaveholding state. They were opposed in the special elections called in 1861 (to discuss secession) by a powerful group of merchants from St. Louis, led by Francis Blair. He formulated an snit-secession argument for the \"Constitutional Union\" party based mostly on economic ties with the North, rather than an explicit anti-slavey message. \\n In any case, in the February 1861 elections held to select a convention to discuss secession, about 80 percent of Missouri voters voted for Unionist parties and only 20 percent for secessionist parties. \\n Blair scored a coup by persuading the special convention to move from Jefferson City (in the slave belt) to St. Louis, and also organized Germans in that city into \"Wide Awake\" paramilitary groups. Those Germans, as well as regular Federal troops and Illinois militia troops, seized a secessionist campground outside of St. Louis in May, as well as the St. Louis armory, forcing the pro-secessionist legislature to flee back to Jefferson City, then to Boonville, then to the southern parts of the state. After that and during the war, the Union troops controlled St. Louis and the major railheads; Confederate and irregular troops raided rural and particularly western Missouri, but had no chance of forcing secession. Regular Confederate troops were driven out of the state after the Battle of Pea Ridge (near Springfield) in March 1862. \\n So, the tl;dr: of that is as such:  At least in 1850s Missouri, slavery was an important issue to many people, bound by economic ties to what slaves produced. But even slaveholders subordinated their own feelings about bondage to win elections in a state where a majority of whites were non-slaveholders. Many of the non-slaveholding whites were not friends of the planters, but did not necessarily want slavery to end. Anti-slavery sentiment was strong in some groups, but not a majority of groups. And people tended to vote with reference to their own economic interests. \\n Plenty of sources on this, but the most pertinent to the answer I gave was [Michael Fellman\\'s Inside War: The Guerrilla Conflict in Missouri during the American Civil War.]( \\n Also, this hopefully helps illustrate why \"it\\'s complicated\" applies. \\n',\n  0),\n ('(Warning, my Belgian pride coming up ;) ) \\n Eben-Emael was ofcourse a fortress in a country that was up to that point morbidly neutral.

One of the benefits of landing at Normandy was that there were not many major ports to house Kriegsmarine ships along the coast. The Germans had been led to believe that the attack would be at Calais, a major port and the closest point between the English and mainland European coasts. If the U-Boats were even able to leave their ports to aid in the defense, they would be positioned in a way to defend the Calais coast. \\n The Allies maintained a very powerful naval defense on both sides of the English Channel to prevent any U-Boats from attacking the vulnerable transport ships, meaning that U-Boats would not be able to hinder the invasion from the northeast. Additionally, transport had their own convoys so that any enemy ships that slipped through the blockade would be dealt with quickly. \\n TL;DR: Allies used deception and a massive naval presence to prevent U-Boat interference during the D-Day landings. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"There are a lot of variables here, and I'm mostly just addressing the latter years of dueling, from the late 1700s onwards. [I've written previously about the etiquette of a duel]( which I'll repeat here as it will help with the answer: \\n > There was a very rigid procedure to dueling, and various dueling codes came about, the most famous being the Irish Code Duello, which was very popular in the late 1700s through the 1800s, and from which I draw most of this.\\n> \\n> Now, lets say you insult me, and I challenge you to a duel! As the challenged party, you may choose the weapons. The traditional weapons are swords or pistols, but uncommon ones were sometimes chosen. If you chose swords, and I am not a swordsman, I can request a different weapon, but must accept the second choice.\\n> \\n> Now, there are all kinds of minor rules which I'm going to gloss over and instead cut to the chase. The underlying idea of the duel is to satisfy honor. Seconds are chosen, and generally, the seconds are going to attempt to stop the duel by agreeing to terms under which you, the offender, can agree to apologize to me, the offended, to which I would agree. This will go on right up to the point when we are standing  en garde . But, once at that point, it would be considered extremely bad form for you to  now  apologize. \\n> \\n> The common trope is a duel to first blood. This was not the case. To agree to a duel to first blood was very poor form. Rather the duel was  at least  to first blood. If with swords, once the duel began, you can't ask to be pardoned for your offense until I've drawn blood, otherwise you'd be in very poor form. If with pistols, you can't ask for a pardon until shots are exchanged. The duel would continue until I, the offended party, either agree to accept your apology, or else have decided honor is satisfied. In many cases though, the offender merely showing up to the duel would be enough, and no fight would even occur! On the subject of first blood, while agreeing to first blood was poor form, that isn't to say there wasn't an implicit understanding - especially by the mid-1800s, that it was the point the duel would end, but still, to vocalize that was frowned upon. \\n Now, what that all is to say is that a duel might be very quick and end with nothing more than a pin prick, or it might keep going and going until one (or both) were too bloody and incapacitated to continue the fight, or else dead. The biggest part of what we see in the movies that  isn't  true is the fancy swordplay. Thats a good way to get stabbed. In a real duel, the biggest priority is not getting killed yourself! Because duels happened well into the 20th century, we actually have some real ones captures on film, which might give you an idea of how they were fought. Here is one from  1967 , it kind of illustrates how much it was just about honor for both parties, and not about the ultimate revenge. While when one swordsman was clearly the better it might not last very long, more generally a lot of the duel was spent on these small, positional movements and light feints. \\n So TL;DR Duels went until honor was satisfied, which could be a single wound, or a dead swordsman. \\n [I've also written a piece about some 20th century duels you might find of interest.]( \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"Primary sources: \\n \\n Caesar's The Civil War (obviously partisan but very enjoyable) \\n \\n Appian The Civil War \\n \\n \\n Secondary Sources: \\n \\n Syme: Roman Revolution (pretty dense but really explains the downfall of the Republic and the rise of Augustus) \\n \\n Goldsworthy: Caesar \\n \\n \\n Obviously this isn't a comprehensive list but stuff I've personally read and enjoyed.

The thing is that dogs weren\\'t so much domesticated as that they evolved alongside humans. Wolf-like ancestors benefited from travelling near nomadic people (scraps were easy to find) and humans either had no benefit or had some protection from other wild animals. Eventually this symbiotic relationship lead to wolves becoming more \"dog like\" with juvenile traits extending into adulthood and more friendly towards humans. Eventually humans, out of empathy and/or benefit, took care of the dogs more personally. \\n As for more exotic pets with no perceived benefits, I have no idea. Kings and rulers have always enjoyed having exotic animals from deer to sloths. Main stream pet owning probably took place after humans began to settle and had the resources to provide for a creature. \\n I\\'m not sure, but askscience might have more records of prehistoric pet owning from bones of humans together, or something. \\n TL;DR: Pets originally came from beneficial relationships for humans and the animals, and exotic pet ownership came at some unknown (at least to my knowledge) point where humans had the desire and resources to care for them. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"Well thank you! \\n I would certainly argue that demilitarizing Germany was  possible , just unlikely in the time of the Weimar Republic. It was certainly done in West Germany after the Second World War, but I would argue that democratization worked in the Fifties because the Bonn government had no other choice: they were under occupation by the Allies and their military had been wholly disbanded. The same was emphatically not true of the Weimar Republic, which by its very constitutional definition was destabilized from the start by its crippling lack of power or unity. Even if the  Reichstag  had been totally unified under, say, a Social Democratic government, the odds that any sort of political organization could have challenged the Army over its political influence are slim to none. \\n In order to demilitarize Germany, one had to force the German people to realize that their military had done something wrong. I think this really was one of the big successes of the denazification programs in the late 40s: Germans were so appalled at the suffering not only brought on themselves but that their military and paramilitaries had wrought on innocent civilians, however subhumanly the general population had treated them, that they really had no stomach to ever fight another war again, much less an aggressive one. \\n tl;dr: not really, because after World War I the Army was seen as the good guys, whereas the democratic government were seen as traitors in large parts of society. The Army also had way too much power for a civilian government to displace, so the Weimar government had no choice but to leave things alone and hope the military wouldn't usurp them. \\n A caveat: perhaps if the Weimar's constitution were more rigid about stamping out German militarism, but that's very hard to speculate upon. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"The Spanish Civil War was quite important in proving the concepts that the General Staff had been working on during the 20s and 30s. For instance, the German brigades in Spain often used early forms of the Panzer tanks that would roll across Europe in a few years, and the experience gained on the battlefield there helped German officers and engineers to learn what worked and what didn't. The Condor Legion's experiences in strategic bombing and air-to-air combat became invaluable in training the Luftwaffe to its tip-top caliber by the beginning of the war, and undoubtedly the lessons learned there helped in engagements like the Battle of Britain or the German slaughter of the Red Army Air Force early in Operation Barbarossa. Spain gave infantry schools the chance to test new tactics and theories that had gone unperfected since the dying days of WWI (stormtrooper tactics in particular), and in the years following they would be instilled in the large numbers of NCOs and officers being raised to fight the war. And finally, most importantly, it allowed the Army (and Hitler) to size up the West and the USSR through the scope and force of their interventions in Spain, and gave the German Army a few pointers on how to deal with Soviet equipment and the occasional Allied soldier. \\n I would also argue that Spain was the point at which Hitler began to realize the West would do nothing if he interfered in the affairs of  other nations . Compared to his targets of Austria and the Sudetenland, the Ruhr had been child's play (as it was already really German, few nations could deny that), and Spain showed him that Britain and France were too fractured to offer even token assistance to a nation in danger of falling to fascism. \\n tl:dr; the Spanish Civil War was basically a huge live-fire exercise for the German units sent to fight, and Hitler learned how far he could push the Western Allies politically. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"In the 1500's, Russia's world outlook was much different.

It wasn\\'t illegal, but it was probably unethical and was rather unpopular. \\n In 1988 the Israeli elections resulted in a parliament with 40 seats held by Likud (the major right-wing party), 39 held by Alignment (the major left-wing party, the forerunner to today\\'s Labor), 13 held by a group of religious parties, and the rest held by various left and right-wing parties, out of a total of 120 seats.  Because of the First Intifada, the coalition was a Unity Government--Likud, Alignment, the religious parties, and the National Religious Party (a religious far-right party, not part of the Chareidi block the others are part of) together, comprising a large majority of parliament, with Likud as coalition leaders and Shamir (a Likud MK) as PM. \\n The US had proposed Israeli-Palestinian talks, a proposal which was quite contraversial.  Likud was staunchly against it, but Alignment was strongly in favor.  After Likud firmly rejected talks, Alignment brought a motion of no-confidence, which passed.  Shimon Peres, head of the Alignment, was tasked with forming a coalition.  However, he simply couldn\\'t get a majority in parliament who agreed with the proposal for talks. \\n So he tried to get the support of the religious parties.  Some of them have political agendas, others are single-issue parties, trying to get benefits for ultra-Orthodox communities in Israel.  If Peres could convince the religious parties to join a left-wing coalition, he would  just  have a stable coalition.  The question was how to get their support. \\n The answer was to promise enormous benefits to them.  Essentially, he\\'d be giving them huge concessions in order to join with parties who were ordinarily staunch secularists.  It was a strange pairing, but with enough guarantees to the religious parties it might work. \\n Peres thought he had the support of the religious parties to form a coalition.  But one by one, they dropped out.  One Rabbi who held a lot of influence in Degel haTorah said they shouldn\\'t join with the secularists in parliament, in a speech in which he called the left wing \"eaters of pigs and rabbits\", i.e. they didn\\'t keep kosher.  Ovadia Yosef, spiritual leader of the Shas party, followed suit, which had a much greater effect than Degel haTorah\\'s defection--Degel haTorah held only two seats, but Shas had 6.  On the advice of a prominent Chasidic Rabbi, the third religious party decided that giving up land would be religiously forbidden, depriving the government of 5 needed seats.  The Alignment\\'s left-religious coalition collapsed before it formed.  Despite some last-minute dealing, the time for Peres to build a coalition ran out, and the government passed to Likud, who successfully formed a right-wing government from right-wing and religious parties, barely constituting a majority. \\n The Israeli public was angered that such a small faction had acted as king-makers in coalition-building, forcing the government to follow the whims of a minority.  Even left-wingers didn\\'t like the attempted coalition, since it circumvented the majority, rather than negotiating with it, and partnered with religious parties that the left wing often didn\\'t care for.  Peres was outed as the Alignment\\'s leader, replaced by Rabin.  The demands were met with the ultimately temporary change of direct elections for Prime Minister, which was intended to prevent a similar move.  In the end, the right-wing coalition entered talks anyway, under somewhat different terms in the Madrid Conference. \\n tl;dr Israeli politician tried to form left-wing coalition by negotiating with religious parties.

The rooms got smaller and smaller as you went higher up - the bottom floor had relatively nice, roomy rooms which were regularly rented out as shops.

TL;DR: Platoons were numbered consecutively at the Battalion level \\n A potential explanation. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('I think your statement about Midway demonstrates perfectly this question of is history inevitable? My personal opinion is that people focus too much on one event without taking into account the context behind it and this phenomenon particularly seems to manifest itself with battles. Taking your example of US victory at Midway being improbable in context of the history around it I would argue that even if the US had lost the battle history would largely be the same. Battles are normally the symptoms of the civilizations involved in them, not the causes. During WW2 the US had such a huge industrial edge over Japan that its victory was basically assured. If the US had lost Midway it would have set this victory back but would not have prevented it. Maybe the USSR conquers more of Europe as US attention shifts to the East, maybe Australia gets ravaged like China did, but the overall result would likely have been the same and thus in a sense history is inevitable. \\n Continuing this trend let us return to everyone\\'s favorite source of \"battle that changed the world\" the Roman Empire and more specifically the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest which saw the anhilation of some 20,000 Roman soldiers and the repulse of an invasion of Germany. People like to claim that this battle changed the fate of the world and that it prevented a Roman invasion of Germany like they did in Gaul yet ignore a few very important facts. One, the Romans returned to Germany and kicked Arminius\\'s ass in several battles until they accomplished what they originaly intended; the subjection of the Germanic tribes so that they would quit rebelling and raiding. It is likely that they never intended to conquer such a worthless plot of land as Germany. \\n And the second point people tend to forget is that this happened during the reign of Augustus when the Roman Empire was at the height of its asskickery ability. Beating the Romans in battle is doable but winning a war against them at this time was impossible. Just ask Hannibal how his war with Rome went. He beat them in numerous battles and some estimates claim he killed over 20 percent of the Roman population who were eligible for military service during this time period. Let that number sink in and then digest the fact that 50,000 Romans died in one day at the battle of Cannae. 50,000 people dead in one day and 20 percent of your able bodied male population dead in a span of a few years. Thats the equivalent of the modern day USA suffering almost 15 million deaths in only a couple years of war. Can you imagine what would happen capitulate if casualties even remotely that horrible were inflicted upon us, especially if the war appeared lost as the second Punic war did to the Romans? Yet the Romans did not quit even after suffering these massive losses and this is, IMHO, the defining characteristic of the Roman people and what made them great. Beat them in battle, repulse their invasions, but in the end they will grind you into dust until you unconditionally surrender and accept their majesty. \\n What does this have to do with the original post? Well, it helps show that while certain parts of history can be changed by singular events, the overall narrative largely remains the same. Kill Hitler as a baby boy? Do you have any idea how militaristic the Germans as a people were in the early 20th century and how pissed they were at how things ended after WW1? We might have been sparred the holocaust but WW2 would still have happened. There are of course exceptions to this, certain religious leaders such as Muhammad are so deeply embedded in History and changed things so much that the removal of them from the narrative changes everything. Nothing happens in a vacuum and thus nothing can claim to have arisen on its own. This is not to say that people are powerless to make decisions and change history, only that long term trends create a kind of inertia that is really hard to overcome. \\n TLDR: History is really fucking complex and very few singular events or people have the capacity to change it. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Not too sure on the cultural reasons, but for your question #3, the West Lothian Question arises because the British Parliament has full freedom to legislate on English law and policy; there is no separate English Parliament.

The piece appears to be derivative of the law review article it links to, however, so for the rest of this comment I will address the law review article instead of the initial article. \\n The underlying law review article  is  a serious and nuanced work of history. If you want to engage the argument, the article by Bogus is worth reading carefully. On a quick reading of Bogus, I find few factual representations with which to take issue, and I find many arguments that are unobjectionable, and none that hide the ball — though the discussion of Timothy McVeigh is certainly a detour. \\n That said, I have some caveats: \\n First, on the whole, the slant and interpretation that Bogus gives is not the mainstream view. The mainstream view is represented by someone like Akhil Amar in his book on The Bill of Rights, and Bogus is uncharitable in referring to it flatly as an \"insurrectionist\" view. More mainstream scholarship emphasizes, first, a more complicated structural account of the militia, and second, ambiguity between militia-based and self-defense-based rationales behind the Second Amendment. These accounts are not inconsistent with fear of slave rebellion being a motivating factor in the ratification of the Second Amendment, but they emphasize a much broader set reasons why the Amendment came about. \\n In this respect, the mainstream account of the Second Amendment is like accounts of much of the Constitution. Slavery was a major issue of the day and it is a part of the story behind many diverse and seemingly innocuous aspects of the Constitution; but it was not the sole reason behind these many provisions. The taxation power, the electoral college, the design of Article IV: all these things reflect the importance of slavery in the design of the Constitution; but it would be unfair to say the preserving slavery was their purpose. I would say the same thing about the Second Amendment. \\n Second, it should be remembered that Bogus is only discussing the Second Amendment proper. In popular discourse, the Second Amendment is used to refer to the right to keep and bear arms as guaranteed by  both  the Second Amendment (as against the federal government) and the Fourteenth Amendment (as against the state governments). In many respects, it is the Fourteenth Amendment (and not the Second Amendment itself) that is more important, and more reflective of commonly held ideas about what the right to keep and bear arms means. \\n The Fourteenth Amendment has its own different history, and it grows out of the abolitionists\\' view about the right to keep and bear arms. Passed during Reconstruction, one of the amendment\\'s avowed purposes was to secure for freed blacks the means with which to defend themselves against white terrorism. Another was to secure recognition of black citizenship, for which the possession of arms had long been a potent symbol, both among slaveholder and abolitionists. \\n tl;dr:  The pro-slavery influence is real, but should be put in the proper perspective. Abolitionist influence was also important, probably moreso. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Before the advent of recording, music was fairly rare, but depended on the situation (especially social class).  I can comment briefly on America in 1910 and Germany post-1850.\\nIn 19th century Germany, music would have been heard in church, where there was typically an organ, a choir, and possibly even a small orchestra or chamber ensemble.  This was often the grandest scale of music that most people would hear.  For the upper classes, this was the period where having a piano in the home, and amateur singing became a popular focus at parties.  Case in point, Schubert wrote dozens (if not hundreds) of short songs (Leider) for voice and piano, and even began a tradition of gathering people in a private home to sing and play them.  People still hold \"Schubertiads\" to this day.\\nThis was also the period in which formal concerts arose.  Before that, going to hear an orchestra was a social event, with lots of eating, drinking, and talking - and who knows how much actual listening to the music.  But Liszt was the one who introduced the idea of sitting quietly for a concert, and by 1900, concert and opera halls were huge, and well-attended.  Again - if you were rich, you could hear a lot of music!\\nI know less about folk, or lower-class music of this period.  I would say that music was much less common, and depended on one or two people in a town having instruments - possibly fiddles, flutes, drums, that sort of thing.  200ish years before this, the bagpipe was the most popular folk instrument in much of Europe, but that was on a decline, and I\\'m not too sure what followed it.  So there could be music at festivals and celebrations, and of course casual singing like in the tavern, but formal performances must have been rare. \\n 1910 in America was a pretty interesting time for music.  Church still featured choir and organ, and pianos were nearly ubiquitous in middle and upper class homes.  While America was struggling to find their place in the classical music world, they were importing tons of music from Europe - Opera and orchestral performances were common, and the programs were full of things like Beethoven, Berlioz, and Bruckner.  I believe 1910 (give or take a year) was when Mahler visited America.\\nVaudeville was also in full swing at that time, and so finally common people were able to hear music on a fairly regular basis.  Vaudeville performers sang and played instruments like piano, banjo, and mandolin - the last one was especially enjoying huge popularity. \\nLike in 19th c Germany, if you wanted music, you had to make it yourself most of the time.  White people in the southern states were using fiddles, mandolins, banjos, dulcimers, to play music based on celtic roots - we call it \"old time\" music now, and it was to evolve into things like bluegrass and country and western.  At the same time, African Americans were developing delta blues, ragtime, gospel, and \"work songs.\"  These would be performed at celebrations, or sung casually any time. \\nThe big thing to remember is that recording was just starting to become a viable industry - while still a rarity in 1910, phonographs were about to explode, completely changing the way(and the frequency with which  ) people could experience music. \\n TL:DR:  In 1910 America and late-1800s Germany, if you wanted music, you had to make it yourself.  How often that happened depended on how much money you had.\\nPerformances have gotten more and more common as time has gone on.  1910 was actually a pretty great time to hear live music, even if you weren\\'t filthy rich. \\n',\n  0),\n ('First, tenets is a problematic thing to look for.  If you\\'re looking for something like \"[Because Marduk so love the world he gave His only begotten son...]( or \"The [Four Noble Truths]( of Horus\", you\\'re not going to find them.  Tenets like those are things we can find in scriptural religions and religions influenced by them, but for the most part, what we call \"religions\" don\\'t have basic tenets (we\\'re probably all at least vaguely familiar with Greek and Roman myth and religion--what are some of the basic tenets?  \"You should make sacrifices to the gods when good or bad things happen or when you want good or bad things to happen?\"  (As always, for a study of how we even started using the term \"religion\", I recommend J. Z. Smith\\'s article \"Religion, Religions, Religious\" [[pdf](  If we understand \"religion\" to be \"a systematic account of transcendent rather than physical reality\", you have to realize that many of the earliest traditions were local and highly malleable.  \"Religious stories\" featuring divine beings and powerful wizards could also be based on mundane physical events which is to say that what we call history and religion were not two separate genres until much, much later.  Ritual practice too was likely heavily mixed up in daily practice: even things like cutting hair and trimming nails may have had ritual elements to them, as likely did the slaughter of meat.  We just have no details of them.  These traditions were often local, and without writing, there\\'s not much we can do but guess at what they \"meant\", because ultimately, I read your questions as one about meaning.  So let me say what I can say and maybe others can add to it. \\n Instead, of looking for \"religion\", let me suggest we look for the earliest signs of MYTH and RITUAL.  I\\'m not an archeologist, so perhaps someone like /u/Aerandir, /u/Brigantus, or /u/400-rabbits (among many others) can tighten what I say up.  The first signs we have of RITUAL (and implicitly myth) are  intentional burials .  To most, intentional burials indicate  something , though it\\'s not always clear what.  /u/400-rabbits took the time a while ago to answer [my question about]( about when the earliest intentional burials were for questions about dating.  Let\\'s say for convenience here, that\\'s 90k years ago.  But I think it stands to reason that these are signs of some sort of spiritual afterlife--is that a basic belief? \\n Next, we have  cave paintings  (starting about 40k years ago), which some people argue show basic myths, but I feel like are much harder to interpret even the basics of than burial (again, I\\'m not an archeologists so there may be more consensus about what they \"mean\" than I know).  Next stop I want to make is perhaps the first ritual site: Göbekli Tepe in Anatolia.  This site has been in the news recently (see this long article by Elif Batuman in  the New Yorker .  This is about 11,600 years ago, though we don\\'t really know what they did (keep in mind this site is so old it predates not only metal but  pottery ).  What we\\'re getting from Göbekli Tepe is circles of pillars with simple animal reliefs, so it\\'s difficult to say what it\\'s \"all about\".  There are theories, to quote from the Nat Geo article: \\n >To Schmidt, the T-shaped pillars are stylized human beings, an idea bolstered by the carved arms that angle from the \"shoulders\" of some pillars, hands reaching toward their loincloth-draped bellies. The stones face the center of the circle—as at \"a meeting or dance,\" Schmidt says—a representation, perhaps, of a religious ritual. As for the prancing, leaping animals on the figures, he noted that they are mostly deadly creatures: stinging scorpions, charging boars, ferocious lions. The figures represented by the pillars may be guarded by them, or appeasing them, or incorporating them as totems. \\n That\\'s really a theory.  But we can presume pretty easily that rituals happened here, even if we\\'re not sure why and what they meant. \\n Skipping ahead a little further, writing really changes what we know about myth to say the least.  Sumerians take the cake for this one.  We get the so-called \" Sumerian Creation Myth , the [Lament for Ur]( around 2000 BCE, [Emmerkar legends]( starting around 2000 BCE. \\n The alternative might be Egyptian mythology, where unification of Upper and Lower Egypt occurred in the pre-dynastic period (3100BCE), with Pharaoh being an important part of mythology, along with gods whose names we know like Horus and Set.  My chronology of the emergence of Egyptian religion is bad, however, and I can\\'t tell you when we get our first written stories, but I am fairly certain even in Old Kingdom times we have cultic texts (I believe indicating both myth and ritual).  By the Middle Kingdom (2000-1700 BCE), we\\'re apparently getting a lot more texts.   The creation of an Egyptian state (along with Egyptian writing), however, probably did a lot to make small, local traditions into national, standardized traditions in terms of both myth and ritual. \\n Lastly, we have purely archeological things and reconstructed linguistics, like the attempts at finding the proto-Indo-European religion.  We can say somethings about it: we can make good guess at the names of some key gods, and figure out what their most general attributes are.  If you want to go further, you\\'re making more contentious arguments.  My favorite of these are Bruce Lincoln\\'s series of articles in the 70\\'s (starting with \"The Indo-European myth of creation\",  History of Religions , 1975), which I don\\'t think even he believes anymore, where he actually tries to figure out the earliest Indo-European myths (I haven\\'t read these articles in a while, but I believe he argues that the first myth is the first man slaughtering his twin and thereby simultaneously creating the priesthood and [pastoral] agriculture).  These are  highly  speculative and based on certain assumptions (like the tripartite division of Indo-European society) that people are less likely to make today.  They\\'re fun reads, nonetheless. \\n tl;dr: probably Egypt (Old or Middle Kingdom depending on your standard) or Mesopotamia (Sumeria specifically if a couple of myths count as religious tenets; Babylonia if you have a stricter standard and want more ritual details), but either way we\\'re probably talking the 2,000-1,700 BCE range.  We can try to reconstruct things like Proto-Indo-European religion, but again that\\'ll be highly speculative. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Greatest is not a term that is easily quantifiable but my reasoning for him being the \"greatest\" would largely be down to the sheer volume of work he produced and, perhaps crucially, the sheer volume of his works  that survived . \\n One of his contemporaries, Christopher Marlowe, is considered to be an excellent playwright, and there are some who believe that he actually wrote some of Shakespeares works (this is heavily disputed and almostly certainly false.

(Allegedly.) Second to that, the \\'three R\\'s\\' are the educational standard, and most people were no longer learning Latin. \\n Many of the upper class/upper-middle class boys still were, though, albeit with less intensity after other subjects were introduced. The independent public schools (old and new) had various reactions to the changing student population, and began to be known for different specializations. Winchester became the popular destination for the children of industrialists, and their curriculum changed accordingly (here\\'s where you\\'d find your economics). Shrewsbury has been described as perfectly upholding the Classics. Rugby became the bastion for \"muscular Christianity.\" (The sport is named for the school.) One of the notable changes made in the course of the 19th century was to provide boys with the same moral guidance the girls had been receiving. This was accomplished in part through physical education, army training (like ROTC programs), and the playing of organized sports. (Athleticism was the perfectly \"Victorian\" answer to the problem of adolescent hormones.) Despite that moniker though, the independent schools actually became more secular. Church-run schools had emerged to cater to religious scholarship. Academic competition was also encouraged, and we start seeing merit scholarships being awarded to these top primary schools, resulting in more mixed environment of socioeconomic backgrounds among the student bodies. (This is something touted by the schools themselves; a later commissioner wrote \\'Jude was still likely to remain obscure.\\') \\n Maths were now emphasized across the board. Modern languages, modern history, English grammar, physics, chemistry, and biology/zoology were being taught at all levels. Arts and music, however, became relegated to pastimes - still a part of school culture, but not really part of the curriculum. This is not unique to the boarding schools, either. The time honored tradition of politically or fiscally motivated School Boards and Boards of Governors giving the axe to arts education began at the end of the 19th century. (They seem to continually bring it back just so it can be cut again!) \\n Another part of the reforms to the existing independent schools was establishing fixed ages of attendance. Above, I said \\'around age 8\\' but in reality, children were entering at any point between ages 5-10, and then staying as many was 12 or 14 years. By 1900 we have set classifications by age groups in  all  schools. Infant Schools were for children below age 7. These were sometimes coeducational, but subsequent schools were single-sex. Junior Schools were for 7-10. Senior schools were for 10+. Existing schools had to split or reclassify their sections to accommodate these brackets and the accompanying educational standards. By 1900 we start to have Kindergartens - the Dame Schools were completely gone. We also start to have \"higher grade\" schools for people over 14-15. \\n Middle and working-class students were receiving solid secondary education for the first time. RWA were finally mastered, and students in higher grades focused heavily on math, science, drawing, and then the Latin worms its way back in here. Attendance in 1900 was not widespread, but it grew rapidly in the early part of the 20th century. For those who did the whole program, the school experience was starting to look very modern. Graduates at 15 or 16 were versed in \"English language and literature, geography, history, a foreign language, mathematics, science, drawing, manual work, physical training, and, for girls, housewifery.\" \\n Education for upper and middle-class girls was increasingly focused on scholarship on par with the men from the mid-19th century, although that damned needlework remained as a part of formal education well into the 20th century. Upper-class girls entered into the same independent public schools that had been established for middle-class girls the century before, with elective courses in \"the accomplishments.\" \\n TL;DR 1800 - Latin, 1900 - English/Math/Science \\n [A History of Eton College]( 1899, Lionel Cust \\n [Edwardian England: A Guide to Everyday Life, 1900-1914]( 2014, Evangeline Holland \\n Education in England: A Brief History , 2011, Gillard \\n',\n  0),\n ('Absolutely. One small, but good example of this is the historiography of the English Civil War. The earlier interpretations followed the Whig school of thought, which saw the war as part of a natural advancement of mankind toward liberal democracy, enlightenment, etc. \\n Marxist historical analysis, coming from scholars like Eduard Bernstein and Christopher hill, posited that the conflict was a class war. You\\'ve got the feudal interests on one side (King, Clergy, Landlords), against what was a kind of Proto-Capitalist class in Parliament (Buyers of land, traders, \"the Gentry.) In this view, lots of protestant offshoot movements, like the Diggers and Levellers, were examples of peasant class-consciousness. \\n This interpretation of the war was the dominant interpretation for the better part of the 20th Century until Conrad Russel (interestingly, Bertrand Russel\\'s son) and a bunch of other like-minded historians came and shat all over this theory. \\n Like much post-Marxist criticism, the focus of Russel\\'s critique was in the details. Class was not an accurate predictor of how the battle lines were drawn (you had rich families fighting for both the Rump and the Crown, Capital wasn\\'t as dramatically divided as the theory would suggest, etc.). \\n Moreover, Marxism, like Whig histories, are pretty deterministic. In Marxist history, things happen in tides of unstoppable historic causality. But this doesn\\'t hold water; history is a lot more like Game of Thrones, where choices of leaders DO matter, and choices that are shaped by things other than economic / class interest are significant enough to alter history significantly (e.g, in the British Civil War, religious intolerance was a big factor propelling people to fight- a cleavage that Marxism doesn\\'t quite explain.) \\n tl;dr - Marxism is too simplistic and has thus fallen out of favor as a sole-mover of history, but can still be useful to highlight SOME reasons for why things happen. \\n However, it definitely holds sway in certain disciplines.

In certain aspects the technology was updated. Things like 2600 Hz detectors in some of the, at the time, newer switches for instance.

Unfortunately a lot of the specifics are still under wraps since AT&T was always pretty cagey about it.

Evidence of cannabis oil being burned as incence in ancient synagogues has been found, which seems more solid a lead than McKenna\\'s use of fairly abstract cave art to indicate use of mushrooms as part of ancient shamanic rituals in northern africa 20 000 years ago. Still, I believe it, even if the pictures are not related at all! \\n That said, our modern cultures demonisation of plant (and drug use) - while not entirely without merit - seems woefully out of touch considering just how many religions seemed to have been based on altered states of consciousness, induced either through plant use, extreme physical or breath work or starvation. \\n There\\'s also this: \\n >  the theory that bizarre experiences of this sort might be caused by an overactive pineal gland producing excess DMT is a neat idea in that it doesn\\'t necessarily require you to impute the existence of a psychedelic substance that\\'s really nowhere in the historical record. \\n >  DMT, of course, is a highly dissociative hallucinogen that happens to be produced naturally by the human pineal gland in small amounts. But interestingly, some of the research on DMT trips shows a very high incidence (around 50%, IIRC) of reports of feelings of being visited by an alien presence. DMT is also a full dissociative, unlike LSD -- it tends to create the perception of an entirely different reality, not distorted reality (i.e., DMT hallucinations often can\\'t be recognized as hallucinations, if that makes sense). Furthermore, DMT trips tend to be fairly brief (only 10-15 minutes generally, with effects fully fading within an hour, as opposed to multiple hours for psilocybin or LSD). (DMT is also the active ingredient in ayahuasca brew, mentioned in the linked article -- its religious links, particularly in South American shaman culture, are quite well known.) \\n >  Without taking a position on whether these \"visitations\" are real or not, some of the researchers conducting the study pointed out that this hints at a potentially elegant and very consistent explanation for reports of, e.g., UFO abduction -- the pineal gland tends to be most active late at night, around 3-4 AM, which is (apparently) when many alien abductions are reported. Also, a potential explanation for why some people tend to report multiple encounters could be that those individuals happen to have exceptionally active pineal glands, or even some sort of disorder that causes their bodies to over-produce DMT. \\n >  Of course, the explanation also seems to match up very well with many other \"paranormal\" experiences, particularly religious visions. And part of the reason the theory is so compelling is that it doesn\\'t require you to posit the ingestion of a psychedelic substance -- it could merely be a rare or even transient pineal disorder that causes the spontaneous dissociative experience, possibly in combination with an MAOI, which is somewhat more plausible and which could be fairly innocuous on its own. And even more interestingly, dimethyltryptamine is a monoamine that\\'s usually broken down very quickly by the body -- so if DMT was the cause of these experiences, it would leave little physical trace after the fact. This would also explain the lack of other side effects, foreign chemicals, etc. \\n >  For that last reason, of course, this theory is also very difficult to verify, but it\\'s an extraordinarily consistent and fascinating hypothesis. And the \"spontaneous synthesis\" theory seems to me to be at least as plausible as, or even more plausible than, the \"accidentally brewing a 5-DMT / monoamine oxidase inhibitor\" explanation you often see \\n ... such as in Shannon\\'s article above. \\n and by  Manly P Hall  in his book \"The Secret Teachings of All Ages\", more on the acacia and it\\'s symbolism in the middle east\\n>  Among the ancient Egyptians and Jews the acacia, or tamarisk, was held in the highest religious esteem; and among modern Masons, branches of acacia, cypress, cedar, or evergreen are still regarded as most significant emblems. The shittim-wood used by the children of Israel in the construction of the Tabernacle and the Ark of the Covenant was a species of acacia. In describing this sacred tree, Albert Pike has written: \"The genuine acacia, also, is the thorny tamarisk, the same tree which grew around the body of Osiris. It was a sacred tree among the Arabs, who made of it the idol Al-Uzza, which Mohammed destroyed. It is abundant as a bush in the desert of Thur; and of it the \\'crown of thorns\\' was composed, which was set on the forehead of Jesus of Nazareth. It is a fit type of immortality on account of its tenacity of life; for it has been known, when planted as a door-post, to take root again and shoot out budding boughs above the threshold.\" (See Morals and Dogma.) \\n >  It is quite possible that much of the veneration accorded the acacia is due to the peculiar attributes of the mimosa, or sensitive plant, with which it was often identified by the ancients. There is a Coptic legend to the effect that the sensitive plant was the first of all trees or shrubs to worship Christ. The rapid growth of the acacia and its beauty have also caused it to be regarded as emblematic of fecundity and generation. \\n >  The symbolism of the acacia is susceptible of four distinct interpretations: (1) it is the emblem of the vernal equinox--the annual resurrection of the solar deity; (2) under the form of the sensitive plant which shrinks from human touch, the acacia signifies purity and innocence, as one of the Greek meanings of its name implies; (3) it fittingly typifies human immortality and regeneration, and under the form of the evergreen represents that immortal part of man which survives the destruction of his visible nature; (4) it is the ancient and revered emblem of the Mysteries, and candidates entering the tortuous passageways in which the ceremonials were given carried in their hands branches of these sacred plants or small clusters of sanctified flowers. \\n Anyway. All good fun. But that\\'s most history/prehistory for you - it\\'s pretty much all speculation to some degree or another. \\n TL;DR: Plants could well have been the cause of many religious visions or the basis around which communities gathered for rites and rituals, but as with anything in history and pre-history, it\\'s pretty speculative without physical evidence (even written records don\\'t necessarily provide unbiased \\'proof\\') \\n',\n  0),\n (\"Oh, no! It was just a gif of a guy reacting with disproportionate anger to a simple situation. My actual answer to that question (sans .gif) usually involves an explanation of the conventions of Romantic culture in the Middle Ages. Basically, I argue that there's a disconnect between what the culture thought of itself and what was actually happening. The Romantic authors of the late middle ages were engaging in nostalgic discourse, harkening back to an earlier period in their own history when they believed that things were better.

A galleon could make 5-7 knots. \\n Both were replaced by around 1700 IIRC by what you would recognize as a 'modern' sailing ship with a smooth deck line and raised poop deck. These vessels depending on size and configuration could make between 8-12 knots. Some claimed top speeds of 14-15 knots but those are hard to verify. \\n Steam vessels were just entering development in the 1820's. By the time they had reached maturity paddle steamers could make 18 knots. \\n In a sailing vessels, depending on conditions the Atlantic was a 3 month round trip, give or take. Longer if you got lost, damaged, or were unfamiliar with your destination. A few weeks by steamer. \\n Steamers were much faster. Not because the ships themselves were faster than competing sailing ships and clippers, but because they were self propelled. Steam vessels did not have to sail with the wind. They could sail set routes and not be caught in a calm or be forced to tack far off course. The significance of self propulsion for the modern world cannot be overstated. \\n tl;dr - 300 years is an awful lot of ground.

One argument is that the early Kingdom of Wa had a separation of spiritual power and political power, noting that many of the day to day aspects of the kingdom were handled by male relatives.  That separation of power might also help explain the assignment of imperial descent to a female deity. \\n Part of the problem with the hierarchy among the kami comes from the fact that different clans were associated with different Kami, and different recordings of the order of kamis\\' births in different texts reflect shifting power balance between the clans united under the Yamato.

The final order and manner of the kami\\'s birth likely have more complex historical roots than religion alone. \\n Marriage practices also changed over time to become more like the continental, Confucian model.  See p. 429 in vol. 1 of the Cambridge History of Japan: \\n >On the basis of other evidence, such as poems found in the Man\\'yoshu, some think that a matrilineal family system also existed. Some historians are therefore inclined to see an earlier Japanese matrilineal system within the Chinese patrilineal model.

The wife did not change her name or uji (clan) affiliation after marriage.

This can then lead to an exaggeration of certain beliefs and a reduction in rational enquiry and the development of a belief that the group (known as the ingroup) is better than other groups.  This process can then lead to the development of an “outgroup”, a group of people who are different from the ingroup and who are believed to possess none of the ingroup’s redeeming factors.  The ingroup can then start to dehumanise the outgroup, to see them not just as lesser people, but also to see them as something other than human beings; once you have convinced yourself that something is not human, you can begin to legitimise all sorts of brutality. \\n Confirmation Bias \\n We are all quite bad at gathering and processing information, especially when it relates to strongly held beliefs.  We subconsciously delete information which contradicts what we believe and take a greater notice of information which confirms our beliefs.  So the ingroup that has convinced itself that the outgroup is inhuman will only notice evidence to back this up – if they think all Jews are greedy then they will notice all of the Jewish owned jewellers or banks on the high street, but ignore Jewish butchers or greengrocers.  They will also select information which reinforces their belief that the ingroup is special: even very minor achievements by ingroup members can be inflated to levels of legendary status whereas the groups failings may be ignored altogether or explained away as bad luck or even as the fault of the outgroup:  “we’re poor, because greedy Jews are hoarding all the money”. \\n Deindividuation \\n The combination of anonymity and arousal can be very powerful; typically we get emotional or angry, but our resulting actions tend to be reasonable.  Anonymity allows us to take extraordinary steps in response to emotional stimuli, simple things like wearing a uniform or being part of a group can lead us to justify behaviour which would be reprehensible in any other scenario.  Similarly simple things like wearing a name badge can help us maintain the crucial element of self-restraint.  So you’re angry about your Dad dying in the Great War, your family isn’t as wealthy as you think it should be, many of your friends and colleagues feel exactly the same way, some charismatic man with a moustache (more on charisma below) has told you that Jews and other  untermensch  are responsible for all of this.  You are offered the opportunity to join a large organisation which will give you a weapon and a uniform and in this highly emotionally charged state, buoyed by a series of initiation rites, emotional speeches and maybe even a visit from the Fuhrer himself, how are you going to go about righting the wrongs which have befallen you?  Suddenly violence which may have seemed abhorrent only a few months ago seems like a natural response. \\n Pseudo-transformational Leadership \\n The evil twin of transformational leadership, it uses exactly the same processes, but for evil ends.  Transformational leadership theory states that charismatic leaders with a noble cause, who care for and develop their subordinates and encourage intellectual discourse amongst them, will transform the way individuals behave, and thus the way in which organisations perform.  Hitler presented himself as the archetypal European statesman and preached the noble goal of a Germany restored to her natural position of power in Europe.  He made life better for the average German by increasing the standard of living, levels of employment and personal wealth – or at least telling people that he had done so.  He also developed a semi-scientific justification for the persecution of undesirables and promulgated it through very shrewd propaganda.  He transformed the average German’s point of view to the point where persecution was not just acceptable, but something that everyone should actively pursue. \\n Authoritarian Leadership \\n Authoritarian personalities: cling to traditional values; are happy to submit to higher authorities without question; will use punishment routinely for transgressions against their values; dislike subjectivity; may be superstitious; are obsessed with power and dominance/submission relationships; are cynical, especially about human nature; believe the world to be a violent and harsh place; and have an exaggerated concern with sexual goings on.  Hitler can be seen as the archetype of this personality form and, thanks to pseudo-transformational leadership, he encouraged his followers to adopt the same characteristics.  Much research after the war focussed on those convicted of war crimes as well as those who played some part in the execution of the Holocaust – time and again these personality traits came up with the most dangerous being the observance of dominant/submissive relationships, excessive use of punishment and a lack of subjectivity.  These three mean that a person’s decision making process operates as follows: \\n \\n I have been given orders and these orders are correct. \\n There are no excuses, people’s actions are either right or wrong.  \\n Therefore anyone who transgresses these orders must be wrong and so must be punished. \\n \\n TL;DR.   Desensitisation to extreme activities such as genocide isn’t just a matter of exposure to atrocities, but involves a longer process based around a number of psychological processes which allow an individual to justify their abhorrent actions.  The process can be almost entirely sub-conscious and this is what makes it so dangerous. \\n References \\n Bass, B. M. & Riggio, R. E.  Transformational Leadership . \\n Dixon, N.

He was part of the force that attacked the German colony in China, and after graduating from the war college in 1916 he saw time as an attache in Europe.  Unlike other officers, he was very familiar with the consequences and conduct of a war of attrition against industrialized opponents.  He also saw only limited action against China before 1941, and did not take away the hubris the Imperial Army learned in that conflict. \\n In his Malay campaign his respect for his adversary and avoidance of frontal attacks allowed him to win his signature victory.  To some extent flanking maneuvers were standard doctrine for the Japanese army, but Yamashita seems to have fully understood the importance of using them against the enemy\\'s mind and not only his position.  Yamashita\\'s understanding of how to improvise logistics for these tactics were also unusual in the Japanese army, which often disdained logistical concerns.  He also managed to effectively coordinate air and sea actions, a difficult feat due the rivalry between the Imperial Navy and Army. \\n Yamashita\\'s conduct in Singapore in terms of war crimes is mixed.  He personally had some officers and soldiers under his command tried and executed for war crimes (the hospital massacre in particular) but the Imperial forces overall conducted themselves badly and many elements were outside Yamashita\\'s direct control. \\n After his success in Malaysia, he became a general with a lot of prestige but a reputation for political unreliability.  Japanese high command solved this problem by posting him to Manchuria, to confront the Soviet threat, which was taken very seriously by the Imperial HQ.  This also kept him out of the headlines and the war. \\n By 1944, the Imperial high command knew they were going to lose the war.  They anticipated a negotiated settlement, and needed to consolidate their political position to face the resulting political fallout.  That meant they had to get rid of unreliable military figures, Yamashita first and foremost.  So they sent him to the Philippines, with the expectation that he could not and would not return. \\n In the Philippines he devised a plan to try to avoid a head on clash with American forces.  High command interfered and ordered a more forward defense that resulted in immense casualties.  As you point out, his Naval subordinate disobeyed his orders in Manilla, this kind of Army-Navy dysfunctional rivalry was typical of the Imperial forces at many stages of the war. \\n TL:DR Yamashita was perhaps the best Japanese general, both in understanding a modern war of attrition and in his record against war crimes. \\n So why therefore, is he almost the only Japanese general to receive the death sentence?  MacArthur left few answers to the question \"why him.\"   Some people speculate that it was due to personal pique against his Philippine opponent.  My personal opinion is that \"somebody\" had to get prosecuted so that the entire Japanese military would receive the opprobrium it richly deserved, yet why have hundreds of trials and executions once this was established?  MacArthur picked Yamashita for trial because his reputation was so high, trying him for war crimes would establish blame for the entire Japanese military without having the appearance of a bloody purge.  In his final statement before death, Yamashita appeared to accept guilt for the military as a whole, apparently understanding and accepting MacArthur\\'s approach. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"Not as much as you'd expect, the German reparations were paid primarily with long term borrowing from the USA.

All the veggies. \\n When it came to vegetables, the Romans  really  knew what they were talking about - they had asparagus, olives (or are those a fruit?) garlic, onlions, parsnips, gourds, cucumbers, peas, beans, lentils, turnips, other bulbs, leeks, beets, lettuce, barley, rice, nettle-tops...you name it. And of course...they had the almighty  cabbage . If you take Cato the Elder seriously (And he was a grouchy old coot), [the cabbage was literally the greatest vegetable of all time ever ever ever.]( No, seriously. Here\\'s the first paragraph of the pages he wrote praising the damn cabbage: \\n > Of the medicinal value of the cabbage: It is the cabbage which surpasses all other vegetables. It may be eaten either cooked or raw; if you eat it raw, dip it into vinegar. It promotes digestion marvellously and is an excellent laxative, and the urine is wholesome for everything. If you wish to drink deep at a banquet and to enjoy your dinner, eat as much raw cabbage as you wish, seasoned with vinegar, before dinner, and likewise after dinner eat some half a dozen leaves; it will make you feel as if you had not dined, and you can drink as much as you please. \\n TL;DR:  CABBAGE. \\n There were a bunch of different varieties of bread, and the best classification is actually from the medical manual of Celsus (More of a part of an encyclopaedia, really, but..) -  De Medicina . Here\\'s an example of what was considered to be \"light food.\" \\n > After that the following meal had better be a light one, consisting of bread a day old, harsh undiluted wine, roasted meat, all food being of the dryest. \\n But he actually gives a rather fantastic discussion on different classifications of bread, which is super cool. \\n > [...] and of wheat the strongest is siligo, next simila, then whole-wheat, which the Greeks call autopuros; weaker is bread made from cake flour, weakest is ordinary bread [Also called \"grey\" bread - he\\'s talking about wholesomeness here]. \\n So you get a decent perspective on different kinds of bread there! From his earlier note on a \"light meal,\" he recommends the driest foods - of which day-old bread was one. So it would be extremely dry after about a day - probably wouldn\\'t have been terribly edible for too much longer than that, though that\\'s just an educated guess. \\n As for shapes, I actually have another interesting answer for you! Romans baked bread in all sorts of different shapes, though the most common was just a circle. For example, students in Rome would, if they did well in class, possibly receive a baked treat from their teacher - essentially, bread glazed in honey baked into the shape of Greek letters. Cool, eh? :D Though they were punished rather harshly for doing badly. If they got something wrong, they got whipped with a strap. If they just didn\\'t KNOW things, they had to tie knots in the strap first.

Students are capital, and exam results are the end product. This produces terrible results in terms of actually understanding contexts, because while top students in the US end up with massive amounts of memorized materials on the mind before, and during exams or competitions, without context, none of that information has a place to \"stick\" in the brain.

More importantly for logistics, galleys could be dissassembled for storage and maintenance between deployments, which made for lower operating costs despite the higher labor costs.  In an era where materials were generally more expensive than labor, it could be more cost-effective to have a large number of small ships that could be easily replaced than a fewer larger, more expensive ships.  Only in the mid to late 17th century, as cannon designs improved, and new sail layouts were developed, did carracks and xebecs become the dominant ship type in mediterranian naval forces.  Even then, the Ottomans continued to successfully use galleys for littoral operations into the 18th century, in the both the Red Sea and the Eastern Mediterranean. \\n TL;DR: Galleys were good at close-in fights in constrained coastal waters (Eastern Med) and not so good at projecting force across large distances of open sea (Indian Ocean). \\n',\n  0),\n (\"Hopefully, my amateur explanation will not incur the wrath of anyone more professional, and please feel free to comment or correct me if I'm mistaken. \\n All ships, including those in present day, leak. Water pools in the bilge of the ship and has to be pumped out regularly to keep the ship afloat. In the age of sail, this was a near-daily task on most ships. So any ship of sufficient size had onboard pumps that could (generally) both pump out the bilge and pump seawater up onto the deck. In a fire, it could be fought thusly. \\n Having said that, fire was one of the (if not the) primary fears of ship captains. Naval ships had incredible discipline around the storage of combustibles like gunpowder and the use of flame on board the ship (slow matches, which were basically fuses used to fire the cannons, were hung over barrels of water so they wouldn't accidentally set anything alight). Shore batteries that could fire heated shot (cannonballs made red hot in a furnace, thus setting a wooden ship afire with a hit) were true menaces, as were fireships (old ship filled with combustibles and set alight, rudder and sails set to go into a crowded harbor). \\n TL;DR: Avoided it as much as they could, pumped water when they had to. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('You\\'re both kind of right I would venture... /u/Second_Mate is referencing HMS Conqueror because it was designed to  principally  be a ram.

To quote from The Birth of the Battleship by John Beeler (Which includes several discussions of the ram, including a good one around pages 104-107),  \"All British capital ships up to the Dreadnought in 1906 were built with ram bows.\"  It is a pretty minor difference at this point of course, but I\\'m thinking that the distinction is the pointed extension such as with the  Admiral-class here  versus the rounded extension of the Dreadnought herself  here . \\n So TL;DR you both have valid points here. \\n',\n  0),\n ('John Brown was exactly who I thought of when I read the question, but I skipped over the word \"successful\" the first time.

Having a Christian king in charge (the fabled Prester John, possibly) definitely kept it out of colonial hands. \\n Ethiopia also wasn't on the coast. Keep in mind that European penetration into Africa was extremely limited until the first few decades of the 19th Century. Ethiopia was largely inland and spent a long time in isolation from the 1600s to the 1800s. There wasn't a whole lot of good reason to go all the way to colonize Ethiopia. The European powers - namely the British and French at this time - were largely focusing on more immediate gains - the gold fields between Guinea and Timbuktu, for example, or the Caribbean islands. \\n There were travelers there occasionally. James Bruce was a famous one, and he visited in search of the source of the Nile in the 1760s. Later, the poet Arthur Rimbaud visited after quitting writing and becoming a gun runner. There's a lot more information in Graham Robb's excellent Rimbaud biography. Of course, the British actually intervened anyway in the late 1860s and early 1870s to put Yohannes IV on the throne. By that point, the imperial prerogative was for a stable, strong nation in the area to counteract potential French and Italian incursions - by the 1880s the French had present-day Djibouti and the Italians had present-day Eritrea and the British really could use a friendly ruler in the area with established legitimacy, and that was Yohannes IV.

(Vale, Prestwich) Most of those immersed in the culture of chivalry regarded avoiding dishonour as their most important duty. \\n However the difference comes between what their perception of what honourable was and what our perception is. \\n \\n most important was loyalty to their leige. Someone who broke a serious oath to their leige lost most of their honour unless they found some way to justify it. \\n Personal gain/ambition was also a matter of honour. Capturing enemies etc was good for its own sake but it also massivel improved ones honour. (and I am not saying anywhere here that worldly/cynical gain wasn\\'t very important to these men, but that this was viewed alongside considerations of honour. In fact the two were perhaps inseparable because so often doing what was good for you was also good for your honour) \\n \\n Your examples are, to put it gently, misguided. Sometimes laughably so.\\nYou have given a list of examples of things  you  think are dishonourable, transporting your own views back onto people in the past and have failed to account for their perspective. \\n \\n You are right to say that the order of the garter was created by Edward III to bind together his most accomplished men at arms and powerful men at arms. But the important point is that the method by which this was done was the cult of chivalry. What made the order of the garter so effective was that the honour of the Order gave it such presteige that all would remain in the order, cementing them to Edwards cause. \\n \\n Villanising Edwards supposed  sexual dalliances is classic victorian  history \\n \\n Any modern biographer of Edward (Mortimer, Ormrod) and modern historians who have dealt Edward in depth (Rogers, Nicholson) all agree that Edward\\'s faith was remarkably strong and sincere. \\n \\n Phillip was overcome with rage and ordered the Genose ridden down. Today this would be considered dishonourable.  But it doesn\\'t matter what we think is honourable when we are trying to get into the minds of people from a different time and a different culture! \\nPhillip ordered them ridden down because he considered them dishonourable being mercenaries, lower class and most importantly they had failed to make any headway against the english archers. They had broken and run without making impact on the enemy. From his perspective his rage was born of their dishonour and he was not dishonourable to ride through them.\\n> \"Let the boy win his spurs.\" \\n \\n This point precisely proves how important chivalry was. So concerned was Edward III with his son\\'s honour he was willing to risk his son\\'s life in order to allow him to earn hisown honour. (parent/child bonds are biological so it is acceptable for me to infer that this was a sacrifice on Edwards part. There were also tactical considerations). \\n \\n Killing civilians. Again this might seem dishonourable to you personally. Chivalry only applied to those \\'inside\\' the culture. All was fair in war when it came to the lower classes. In fact their targettign was aimed as much at the Presitege and honour of the French King as much as the people themselvse. Edward was essentially saying  because you can\\'t defend your people you have no honourable right to call them your king. \\n \\n Your first point I\\'ve left till the end because it is your most spectacular error. First of all Jean was captured at Poiters because, unlike his Phillip at Crecy Jean  swore an oath on his honour  not to leave the field unless he was dead or captured (Phillip had fled to much dishonour). The money of course would be useful, but the presteige in honour gained by capturing the French king was probably even more important for Edward. \\nWhat happened to Jean II though is an excellent illustration of the importance and sincerity of chivalry. \\nHaving agreed on a (huge) ransom John was allowed to return to France to raise the ransom, on his word of honour and leaving some hostages. His eldest son promptly escaped.

The self-absorbed “Me” Decade, having expanded during the ’80s and ’90s from personal life to encompass the political economy, will soon be the “Me” Half-Century. \\n The historian Tony Judt makes a similar argument in his history of the Left and Social Democracy  Ill Fares the Land . \\n Essentially he says that before the counterculture movements of the 60\\'s, the focus of politics was more about collectivism and economic class. You had the New Deal, Medicare, Social Security, progressive taxation, etc. But the 60\\'s changed the focus to the rights of individuals (once again, gay rights, civil rights, reproductive rights, etc.) and sort of gave rise to a mantra of legitimized selfishness. Obviously all of those movements are things that most of us take for granted and view as good now but the sort of flipside to such an emphasis on individualism was the rise of much more radically conservative economic policies. \\n \"Do your own thing\" became an economic philosophy as well as a social philosophy and so we saw the rise of the unabashed Randian Capitalists. \\n I\\'m doing a poor job of paraphrasing some really complex ideas but I hope this helps explain how some see the 1960\\'s counterculture as the unintentional death of traditional Leftist politics and how this eventually gave rise to the conservative mantra of free markets, low taxes, and less regulation. We couldn\\'t have had Reagan/Thatcher and their neoliberal economic philosophy without the social liberalism of the 1960\\'s, essentially. \\n Edit: tl;dr Some would say that the 60\\'s sewed the seeds of its own demise by shifting political dialogue away from the traditional talking points of the Left (economic and social justice) and towards a broadly defined concept of personal social freedoms (sex, drugs, etc.) and the Right responded by emphasizing personal  economic  freedoms (something that would\\'ve been considered radical/fringe before the 60\\'s). The resulting focus on individualism proved equally helpful to a new generation of Neoconservatives with their neoliberal economic mantra. Hedonism in all forms (be it sex, drugs, or money) was made more mainstream. \\n',\n  0),\n ('There were a few big things that lead to the end of the counterculture. \\n \\n The decline and end of the Vietnam War. Troop levels in Vietnam peaked in 1968 at over 500,000. Nixon, upon assuming the office of the Presidency in 1969, instituted a new policy of Vietnamization where troop levels were significantly lowered while bombing runs became more frequent. Troop levels in 1971 were down to around 150,000. Now that young men were less likely to be drafted and lose their lives in the war, they lost a lot of incentive to protest the war. The anti-Cambodia bombing protests in 1970 were essentially the last major efforts of the anti-war movement. \\n \\n Influence of music. A lot of great music artists of the \\'60s either split up (like the Beatles, Jefferson Airplane, etc.) or died (Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, and Janis Joplin) in the early 1970s. The fact that the last three artists all died of drug overdose proved that drugs really could be dangerous. At Woodstock, many people thought that it would be the beginning of a revitalized \"Woodstock Nation\" counterculture movement, but the disastrous Altamont Concert (headlining the Rolling Stones) in late 1969 where a man got killed and the crowd was out of control sharply contrasted with the peaceful vibe of Woodstock. \\n \\n Charles Manson. Related to concerns of violence coming from Altamont, the string of murders committed by Charles Manson\\'s \"family,\" which appeared, to many Americans, to be a standard hippie commune, countered the \"peace and love\" message promoted by many hippies. The fact that some countercultural magazines tried to defend Manson very early on certainly didn\\'t help. \\n \\n Desire for law and order. The 1968 election was a catastrophic failure for liberalism, coming only 4 years after the most left-wing election in U.S. history. The 1968 protests outside of the DNC, where hundreds of protesters were beaten up by the cops, made many people anxious to return to the simpler days of the 1950\\'s. The result was that 60% of the populace voted for either Nixon or the extremely conservative Wallace. The 1968 election signaled the beginning of the end of the counterculture. \\n \\n Acceptance into the mainstream. At the same time many people were sharply opposed to the countercultural ideals of revolution and tearing down the old society to remake the country, certain hippie fashions and beliefs began to gain widespread acceptance. Men with long hair, a radical fashion statement in 1967, became the norm in the early to mid 1970\\'s. Other ideals, like openness about sex, also became more widely accepted. The result was that it was no longer antithetical to mainstream culture to embrace certain aspects of hippiedom. Since the counterculture thrived on being exactly that, it began to fall apart. \\n \\n \\n There are a whole host of other reasons why the hippie movement fell apart in the early 1970\\'s, such as increasing radicalization of anti-war and black liberation groups, and a much greater focus of selfish, rather than egalitarian, principles in the 1970\\'s, but this should provide a decent overview (I hope). \\n tl;dr: Loss/decline of countercultural heroes; increased fears of violence, instability, and radicalism; and mainstream acceptance of certain hippie principles lead to the downfall of the hippie movement. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Hey, someone lit up my searchlight!

The normal model in African slavery was absorption; chattel slavery in the Caribbean or American model didn\\'t arise on the African mainland on a large scale until the end of the 1700s.  Besides, women who were bearing children were working at less than 100% capacity, and a child slave was a pure consumer of resources until reaching 6 or 7.  Getting new slaves was cheaper, at least in the Caribbean, until very nearly the end of slavery itself (so beyond the abolition of the slave trade). \\n /u/Irishfafnir pointed out a vital component in the gender balance equation.  Women were easier to draw into client or kin networks, had that knowledge, and became part of a household quickly.  The normal model of slavery in African households was absorptive, so this was a vital point.  Male slaves could be absorbed, but their value wasn\\'t as great in an era when chattel slavery within Africa didn\\'t exist the way it did in plantation systems.  (It does come to be later, in the late 1700s, along the coast; eventually it predominates in those regions.)  Only systems of organized state slavery (slave armies, slave food production a la Kongo, etc.) tended to maintain the premium for male slaves. \\n But there are two other main reasons for the gender discrepancy beyond the main value of women with in African societies.  One is the converse: that men were more valuable in export; they commanded higher prices as befitted their intended role as disposable units of labor.  But many slavers actually had orders to buy men in a 2:1 ratio compared to women and children.  \"Men\" meant \"of fighting age,\" so might have been 14-30. \\n There\\'s also another reason why men were more likely to be in the trade: the conditions of enslavement.  The single largest fraction of those enslaved were taken as war captives as a general rule (raiding becomes more important at the very end of the trade and in areas that are badly compromised in terms of authority).  These were quite often men of fighting age, and the capturing society was not eager to try and incorporate these people into their societies.  If they could not exchange these captives for their own people 1:1, then trading them on further was an important goal, because having your enemies fighting in your armies or laboring on your land was naturally a bit of a liability in the short term.  What better way of assuring they never come back, than sending them to the coast?   Those men who went to the coast would usually also be those  without  special skills (iron or goldsmithing, et cetera) insofar as that fact would be known by captors.  As the traffic increases, and raiding/judicial enslavement becomes more common, more of these skilled male slaves do enter the trade, but their skills are very often noticed by buyers and they do obtain \"status\" relative to other slaves (indigenous African ironworking flourishes in Jamaica, for example, and serves to keep plantations running). \\n As the price paid for slaves rose, raiding and direct trading was more economical ever further away from the coast so men would come from further afield as might women.  That\\'s also why capture methods with a greater than zero acquisition cost (raids or wars  meant  to obtain captives, as opposed to slaves as an incidental product of wars for other aims) only arose when the price paid for slaves at the coast truly spiked in the 1700s. \\n Even then, it wasn\\'t true everywhere that men were to be put into the revenue stream; some societies, like Asante, remained net purchasers of slaves throughout the era of the Slave Trade with only a few years when they put war captives into the Atlantic flow.  Slaves were almost always more valuable to Akan societies in the forests than the monetary value realized at the coast, because they were gold miners and efficient farmers, and actively absorbed.  Also, if male captives could be traded for other more useful captives (or kin), that was superior in almost every case provided a slaveholder had a use for that slave. \\n TL,DR in addition to women being more valuable in Africa, men were more desired by the slavers themselves, and with war captives being the largest source of enslaved people, capturing societies were eager to get captive (male) soldiers as far away as possible. \\n',\n  0),\n ('[Part one here]( \\n \\n A negative reaction to joint U.S./South Korean exercises is normal:  What\\'s now known as the \"Foal Eagle\" exercise off the coast of the Korean peninsula has happened almost annually since 1976.

The joint stock companies raised financial capital, which was often invested in physical capital such as trade ships. Physical capital augments labor, but before the industrial revolution this had rather significant limits. The Dutch built dykes and windmills to augment farm labor. Trade ships are more complex than just labor augmentation though... \\n Financial markets as well as raising financial capital also coordinate activity. Given a set level of ships, you can trade locally or long distance. Local trade is lower payoff lower risk. Having joint stock companies allows the risk of long distance even if physical capital is fixed. \\n The advantage of a commercial maritime state is that it has access to many markets. Investing in long distance trade opens up new markets. The larger one's markets the more one can specialize. Baltic grain markets, for example, allows the Dutch to have less farmers and more specialists.

Just as important was the Siege of Vicksburg, Mississippi, which, like Gettysburg, ended on July 4, 1863.  Vicksburg was the last major Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River (along with Port Hudson, which was not as formidable and fell shortly after Vicksburg did).  It prevented Union trade down the river from cities in the Midwest to Union-held New Orleans and international markets beyond, and it also allowed Confederate traffic to cross the river, connecting the \"main\" Confederacy with the western states of Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, and much of Louisiana. \\n In fact, the Siege of Vicksburg was a major reason for Lee\\'s decision to take the offensive and invade Pennsylvania.  He had successfully defended a defensive line in Virginia for months, fighting off major Union advances at the battles of Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville.  But his counterparts in the West had not been so fortunate - they had steadily lost territory in the face of greater Union numbers.  Now a surprise move by Grant had encircled Vicksburg from the rear and shocked the army sent westward to help it into motionlessness.  If Lee could invade the North, attack and raid Northern towns, and then defeat the Army of the Potomac on their home soil, it might give President Lincoln such a fright that he would recall Grant\\'s army from around Vicksburg to reinforce his eastern army.  The same idea had worked, a year before, when Lincoln had withheld troops from Gen. McClellan\\'s army around Richmond for fear of Stonewall Jackson marching on Washington out of the nearby Shenandoah Valley.  Moreover, and an even juicier idea, if Lee could defeat the Army of the Potomac on Northern soil, he might be able to march on Washington himself and dictate a surrender and an end to the war. \\n But that didn\\'t happen, obviously.  Lee lost at Gettysburg.  While he was still able to retreat to his previous defensive line in Virginia, the battle rejuvenated Northern faith in both the war in general and the Army of the Potomac specifically.  Before Gettysburg, the army of the Potomac had had a dismal battle record.  They had been outmaneuvered, out-generaled, and outfought in nearly every battle.  And in their only (major) victory, at Antietam, their commander had held back the killing blow at the final hour, allowing Lee to slip away.  Gettysburg revitalized them - they saw that they could hold a position, that the Army of Northern Virginia was not invincible, and that in a pinch the Confederate generals would make decisions that were just as boneheaded as their Union counterparts.  After they repulsed Pickett\\'s Charge, the soldiers atop Cemetary Ridge cheered \"Fredericksburg!\", seeing it as revenge for the suicidal frontal charges that they had had to make at Fredericksburg the previous December.  They had gotten a taste of victory, and they wanted more. \\n In the South, the simultaneous defeats at Gettysburg and Vicksburg, obviously, had an incredibly demoralizing effect.  After Vicksburg, the Confederacy was split in two: Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana were sliced away and would have to fend for themselves.  Midwestern merchants could trade down the river again to New Orleans and beyond, so they would no longer stand with the anti-war crowd on account of empty wallets.  And the Union\\'s western armies could turn eastward, toward Mobile and Atlanta (though they wouldn\\'t do so until a year later - a long and bloody campaign around Chattanooga had to be settled first).  Gettysburg, meanwhile, turned back the last major invasion of Union territory.  Lee had tried twice and been turned back twice.  He did not have the men or the supply system to ever try again.  All he could do was hold along his line and continue defending, and he barely had the supplies to even do that.  Before Gettysburg he had been able to use better reconnaissance and tactics to drive his opponents away - to fight smarter than them.  After Gettysburg, numbers began to tell, and all his tactical skill could not stop the Union advance. \\n tldr: It was the South\\'s last chance to end the war on their terms, in a quick fashion.  Afterwards the Northern gains were so significant that the South could basically no longer stop them (though they could, and did, still fight like hell every inch of the way). \\n',\n  0),\n ('I think that in order to understand the current state of the Middle East we must go back to the year 613. The year when Mohamed began preaching Islam. Mohamed was part of a bin hashim clan associated with the power quraysh tribe of the Arabian peninsula. The quraysh much like many Bedouin tribes made their income through trade, quraysh especially took advantage of the warring Byzantine and sasanian empires at the time and traded items such as leather for tents, uniforms, weapons, luggage etc.. \\n Many tribes in the Arabian P were territorial and often competed with one another for territorial advances, business opportunities, or other grievances. During the rise of islam, the arab tribes at the time had were in need of territorial conquest and islam was a very convenient ideology to seal together a confederation of (normally warring tribes) together for the sake of conquest. \\n I wont go into to much detail about the origin of many of the common large tribes across the middle east, but I will input that prior to islam, the arabs were pagan tribes that attended the ke3bbeh a shrine conveniently promoted by the Quraysh tribe as a shrine which can be followed by all tribes regardless with which diety one worships. As many of you know, the ke3bbeh is still pursued by Muslims as a destination for a pilgrimage. Arab tribes would attend meccah and pay homage to the shrine, trade their goods then go off to their respected endeavours. It made more economical sense to have these tribes settle at cities, but settling means competition for territories (which needed to be near some kind of an osasis to feed the kettle) so conquest for the arabs became necessary, and that’s why islam gain so much popularity! \\n Now, fast forward to the prophets death (632 if I recall correctly?). while the two empires of sassanians and byzantine destroyed eachother effectively through wars, the arabs were welcomed by many minorities who were ruled by either one of those empires, they were asked to pay taxes to maintain some form of protection under the muslims but maintained their sovereignty. However, abu bakr, the first (and technically only kalipha as the other rashiduns began adopting that title willingly?) was a capable general who successfully continued the arab conquest, however, during and following his rule, issues about successor-ship began arising since many arab tribes felt that ali (mohameds nephew) should have been the successor (that is where the shia sunii divide begins). \\n Ill stop rambling, the arab unification was in the form of conquest and we can trace progress and continuity during periods of conquest. Following the death of the prophet it is difficult to truly argue that the region was united, again in times of war unification was %100 evident, but the ismalic empire quickly fragmented soon their after, with the caliphate of the ummayd running away to spain, the Abbasids in present day Iraq and the mamluks (derived from fatimids) in Egypt. \\n Even under the ottomans, minorities were allowed sovereignty so long as they paid taxes and contributed abled men during times of war. We can again trace time of unification to period of either expansion or war. \\n TLDR: there is a commons misconception that the middle east was at one point wholeheartedly united and there were never any conflicts pertaining to identity, religion, ethnicity etc… this is most certainly not true! There has always been a struggle on the part of minorities to gain some form of independence from the central state( or wyllayat).

It wasn\\'t a solid empire as most today understand the word, but a federation of different German states/kingdoms (Bavaria, Baden, Hamburg, Prussia, etc.) with the Kaiser (the King of Prussia) as first among equals. Each constituent state had a representative on a council that (on paper) controlled important matters of state like foreign policy. The Reichstag was the national legislature, elected through universal male suffrage, with the power to pass legislation and approve budgets. \\n That was all on paper. In reality, Prussia constituted something like 60-ish percent of Germany\\'s territory and population. Because of this, neither the King of Prussia (the Kaiser) nor Bismarck really wanted to share power with the other states. Prussia was also dominated by the conservative Juncker class and so, then, was Germany. The council of representatives from each of the states was pretty much ignored. The Chancellor and ministers were personally appointed and dismissed at the pleasure of the Kaiser. \\n The Kaiser himself, Wilhelm II, proudly claimed to have never read the German constitution. His vision of the monarch\\'s position in government was much more than being a figurehead giving out medals and rubber-stamping royal assent. He hated having to answer to the Reichstag for anything and insisted that ministers report to him directly. The fact that he had complete discretion to appoint the Chancellor meant that the Kaiser often had more impact on the governing of Germany than the elected Reichstag. \\n So tl;dr: Germany wasn\\'t technically an absolute monarchy, as there was a constitution limiting the Kaiser\\'s powers, but the Kaiser was still extremely powerful and influential in the government, too much so in my opinion for Imperial Germany to be called a democracy.

The Machine Gun was seen as a way to drastically increase the firepower of a company and increase its offensive potential and in many ways it was. Artillery, which was stupidly powerful at this point, was seen as a way to obliterate defensive positions and forts and basically force a war of movement. I should also note that both of these were completely true and would describe exactly how it would play out. \\n In the first month of the war it was a full war of movement. The Germans would absolutely crush through dozens of Belgian and French forts like they were paper mache and just keep on marching. Fortifications as they were traditionally known, even when supported by trenches, were completely useless. [Within less than 40 days Germany would take significant gains]( and come quite close to winning if not for some critical mistakes on their part and daring moves on the French\\'s part. \\n What you need to understand is that trench warfare as we know it was technically the exception and not the rule as someone else has said. The Eastern Front, while having trenches, did not have a complex and permanent trench system and maintained a \\'movement\\' based war throughout the conflict. Same goes for the African and Mid-Eastern fronts. However as we all know the Western Front was arguably the most central to the war effort so we need to understand why it happened there and not elsewhere. \\n Well after the German 1st and 2nd Armies were almost completely surrounded and crushed the entire German \"hammer\" was sent reeling back toward Belgium.  As the Germans fell back they had the luxury of choosing the best defensive positions they wanted. Basically, they were willing to give up a few extra kilometers in some spaces if it meant getting advantageous terrain. They would dig in in these places and make it illogical to attack when you could just go North and outflank them. So both sides, at the same time, begin \"racing to the sea\" as it\\'s called to try and outflank the other while they fought battles along the way (as you\\'ll see in the above picture) finally concluding at the very end of October. \\n The reason a \"race to the sea\" could not happen in the East for instance was it just too damn big. This was a relatively enclosed area and the \\'race\\' would be done in about two months while both sides heavily fortified their sides in the process. What also changed from before was that they were not relying on monolithic structures like forts to act as the principle defenders but trenches which were thought of before as merely supporting features to defensive positions. They were now the star and as we\\'ll learn throughout in 1915 and 1916 it\\'s much harder for heavy artillery to neutralize a trench than it is for heavy artillery to neutralize a fort. Something there was no reason to believe to be true based on prior experience where trench supported forts were basically walked over. \\n tl;dr:  The reason they did not see a war of attrition was because it took a very special case for it to happen. Machine guns and artillery were seen as force multipliers for offensives and in many ways they were exactly that early on and as we\\'ll see in 1918 they did have it right from the beginning. However they are also very powerful defensive tools, particularly machine guns, and when combined with intricate and deep trench systems with dozens of feet thick barbed wire it becomes incredibly hard to overcome those positions. However those positions only work in an enclosed space where you have no choice but to attack them head on which is precisely what happened with the \\'race to the sea\\'. Both sides ran out of room essentially and had no other choice but to have a mini-arms race of who could have the most fortified trench as to not be broken through by sheer force. As the Belgian/Northern France front fortified and the front down on the Franco-German border began to stabilize they would also begin to fortify -- being blocked off by the Swiss to continue Southward and flank. With the addition of natural barriers like forests and notably rivers the South in the Franco-German border would actually remain relatively quiet throughout the war. \\n',\n  0),\n ('While interesting, i am not a fan of such approximations.

Imperialism suggests rather a certain lack of direct control and authority--even less direct than British ideals of \"indirect rule\" which were not all that indirect after all--and so tends to be a  metropolitan  concept.  (Consider, for example, that historians understand \"colonial government\" to mean \"government in the colony\" and \"imperial government\" to mean \"government in the colonizing power\\'s own state.\") \\n Per Osterhammel (the English translation, not the original German), p. 21, imperialism is the concept that comprises forces and activities contributing to the construction and maintenance of transcolonial empires--so colonialism is more \"on the ground\" and imperialism is more \"at the center\" by that reading.  The two are not parallel and differing concepts, although one might well argue that imperialism can visit noncolonial systems (e.g., the British in South America) and a state can arguably have colonies without being imperialist if there is no significant body of such possessions. \\n TL,DR: Colonialism and imperialism are not necessarily parallel concepts, but tend to be ones of organization and hierarchical level.  Colonialism is not restricted to  settler  colonialism, but embodies other systems of extended domination and control that induce change in the colonized society. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Central Europe in the 20th century is full with good examples.

It\\'s kind of just happenstance.

Later, the various kingdoms of Iberia became united (well, actually, it was already happening during the time Afonso declared himself king of Portugal, but it became permanent later)--Aragon, Castile, Navarre primarily--through intermarriage and conquest.

Zyklon-B was originally deep eloped as a pesticide; specifically, I\\'m fairly certain it was used as a delousing fumigant. Zyklon-B generally consists of hydrogen cyanide, a stabilizer, and a warning odorant. This odorant was removed from the Zyklon-B produced for the gas chambers.

A lot more keypresses could be spilled on the topic than I have here, so feel free to ask further questions. \\n There are a number of causes for the increasing reliance of governments upon debt. For the sake of clarification: \"country\" in the pre-modern world primarily means the head of state, whether emperor, king, or lesser title; debts were primarily a personal affair. \\n The first, which might seem fairly obvious, is that the related rises of large-scale intercontinental trade, the money economy, and the complexity of financial relationships made such debt a possibility. Only with the rise of banking and \"credit\" can such debts be taken. This is a much longer story than I\\'m going to write, unfortunately, but bear this in mind. \\n Secondly, and just as importantly, changes in military technology, and the sheer growth in army size, drove governments to require vast sums of ready cash to equip, pay, and supply competent armies. Prior to the Military Revolution (think gunpowder and large standing armies), war was fairly cheap for monarchs. When you went to war, your lords and their knights would gather their forces and their levies, and join you on the field (unless they didn\\'t). Armies were small enough, in most cases, to be readily supplied by foraging/pillaging, and the campaign season was rarely more than a few months. \\n This changed dramatically with the introduction of gunpowder, as now a common man, provided someone could arm him, was now roughly competitive with the knight. Army sizes swelled, as recruiters hired the bottom rung men of society, gave them arms, and put them on the field. At the same time, this all cost money. I mentioned before that feudal levies could refuse to muster for the king; the new armies, driven by coin, had no such limitations. \\n Dovetailing with this development, monarchs/state governments gradually developed strong government institutions, from large legal apparatus, to information gathering, to palaces (like Versailles). These all demanded significant expenditures of capital, but also increased the power and scope of centralized government. \\n Monarchs used these developments to become more independent from the goodwill of their nobles, but this came at a large financial price. This was a difficulty for kings, as a majority of the monarch\\'s income typically came in the form of goods and services, rather than money. Peasants typically had little or no coin to spare, naturally, and nobles often had legal exemptions from certain taxes or forms of taxation, limiting the monarch\\'s reach. \\n As a result, monarchs came to increasingly rely on the merchant class, who had access to money. These relationships worked in a variety of ways: as loans, typically given for particular wars or projects; through trading of resources, in which the merchants would receive exclusive access to a share of the product of the king\\'s mines or fields (the Fuggers received almost complete control over the Austrian silver mines, for instance); and, increasingly but altogether insufficiently, through taxation. \\n tl;dr : debt is an important institution in modern states because the financial demands placed on the state, both internally and externally, almost always outstrip revenue. Since the states  need  the money in order to retain authority and power, people with access to money are typically able to make healthy sums from an institution which is relatively unlikely to default. Over time, the result is the accumulation of public debt; while the best economic times might be able to reduce the public debt somewhat, as in the US during the Clinton years, the concerted effort needed to seriously pay down public debt requires many more sacrifices than politicians, or the public, are typically willing or able to make. \\n Further reading: \\n Thomas Brady,  German Histories in the Age of Reformations, 1400-1650 \\n Julius R.

It\\'s important to recognise that what\\'s going on with 666, or 616 in some manuscript variations, is a form of Gematria. That is, the practice of assigning number values to letters and words, and seeing significance in them. \\n Recent arguments tend to identify the number with Nero. If that Latin form of his name is transcribed into Hebrew characters you get 616, while the Greek form of his name transliterated into Hebrew gives 666. However there are some problems with this view, it depends upon choosing \"Caesar Nero\" as the title, a knowledge of Hebrew, and the ambiguity of transliterating into Hebrew. Other name-identifications are possible. \\n Alternatively, the number has been interpreted as not a form of gematria, but simply a figurative number based on intra-Biblical symbolism (cf. the use of 7, 12, 24, 144,000, etc..)

For example in the Davis Cup in tennis, Britain has the third highest total of wins with 9 but its last win came in 1936 and the majority came during an era but it was pretty much just Britain/USA/Australia as strong competitors. Does this de legitimise those wins? You can make a certain argument that it does, you wouldn't consider Britain a Davis Cup power in the modern day although it does still have the 3rd highest total of wins. \\n The World Cup was different in that it started relatively late compared to other footballing competitions (aside from the Euros), the Copa América pre-dates it by fourteen years, various national leagues by more. Thus there was an already established and widespread footballing culture across the world as seen by the varied nature of the nations that entered in 1930. The United States, Uruguay and Yugoslavia are about as varied from each other as possible compared to other events of the time such as the Davis Cup, Ryder Cup, Rugby test internationals, cricket test internationals etc which tended to be rather North America/British Commonwealth focused. Thus even as far back as 1930 the game was in a fairly mature state and the early World Cups featured a good representation of the world (although the developing world was missing). By around 1950 you could even argue that the relative quality of the World Cup for it's era was  better  than more recent tournaments. When Joao Havelange ousted Stanley Rous from FIFA and began expanding the number of teams involved (partly due to altruism and partly because he's the godfather of all FIFA corruption) it diluted the quality. When France '98 brought the total number of teams up to 32, you saw a number of first time qualifiers getting tanked, for example Japan, South Africa and Jamaica. It's only really now in 2014 where this expansion has been fully processed and there's no really awful teams in the World Cup any more, while the African teams have regressed from their exciting teams of the 90s/early 00s, they're still somewhat competent. Nations like Japan have developed massively from where they were walkovers in '98 to a technically adept strong side in the modern day capable of the 2nd round/QF. We're now at the stage where you don't expect thrashings in the group stages...unless you're Spain! \\n The only asterisk against the early World Cups is the absence of the Home Nations. Had the World Cup began 15-20 years earlier, England most definitely and perhaps even Scotland would have won more titles. Even in this period the world game was mature enough for the possibility of some kind of World Cup (the Olympics functioning as kind of stand in) unlike other sports which were more limited in their participation. As it was even in the 1930s despite the rise of quality South American teams such as Uruguay and the development of the Western Europeans, England still could have posed real problems. Italy won the 1934 World Cup but England beat them 3-2 five months later. Just after the next WC in 1938 they beat a Rest of Europe team 3-0 and drew 2-2 with Italy, just after Italy had won the cup again. It took until 1929 for England to lose a match against a non British side (4-3 against Spain in Madrid) and 1953 for a foreign team to beat them in England (6-3 against Hungary). Although it should also be remembered that they only played European teams in this era. England's absence is a mark against the early World Cups but it's not enough to claim they weren't important. \\n tl;dr: Football as a world sport matured much quicker than other team based sports and thus even as far back as 1930 the World Cup mattered, was representative of much of the world game (with only the Home Nations missing out of the footballing powers) and those titles should are still recognised today. Uruguay's titles of 1930 and 1950 are just as important and indicative of the world game at the time as Spain's in 2010. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('I can answer your questions with an extant excerpt from Maria Eliza Kettleby Rundell\\'s book [published in 1808]( Isinglass chips, for the record, is collagen made from fish and used to clarify wine and beer.

So, although the constitution has a few specific agreed upon platforms to set off from, the rest was left for the courts to decide later. \\n The source I read equated it with the way you can interpret the bible to fit your circumstances.

Here's what the Chinese Six Companies had to say about it: \\n > Among our Chinese people a few in California have acquired a fortune and returned home with joy. A desire to obtain competency having arisen in the heart, our people have not shrunk from toil and trouble. They have expected to come here for one or two years and make a little fortune and return. Who among them ever though of all these difficulties? . . . They are compelled to labor and live in daily poverty, quite unable to return to their native land. \\n June Mei estimates that slightly less than about 1/4 of Chinese returned. These figures are based off of immigration statistics, and reports of wives in China yearning for husbands that would never return. The numbers are extremely patchy though, to put things simply. Based off of the changing occupations and placement of the Chinese, I would  wager  that this percent went up as time went by, but the statistics just aren't there, so acknowledge that this is (educated) speculation. \\n In any event, though, most indentured coolies would have had to wait longer than just until their contracts were up. The contracts were often just enough to cover the voyage over and daily subsistence. Only after the contract was over, that's when they would  start  amassing the wealth necessary to return. This itself was a slow process. Working on the transcontinental railroad, for example, an independant laborer would make $30-$35 per month, about $9 of that being spent on subsistence materials. The Chinese were heavily taxed later on, too, with Foreign Miner taxes and even a Chinese Head tax. \\n Those without contracts had a bad time too--paying for the fare from China to the U.S. was expensive enough, but the paperwork and legal hoops on the U.S. mainland could cost 3-4x more than the trip itself. Years of debt would be incurred before the labor even started. \\n Some Chinese would routinely send money back to their families in China, which was another expense. I haven't done research on these numbers (I'm looking to get to it), but one source I've seen pins an average at $30 for those that  did  send things back (meaning we aren't factoring in the zeroes for Chinese sending nothing).

Most of my context here is provided by Barry Strauss\\' book  The Spartacus War , which provides a REALLY good rundown of what it would be like to be a slave. Plus, I have it handy. And stuff. If you\\'d like to read up more on the subject, I\\'d suggest Keith Bradley\\'s  Slavery and Society at Rome . On with the show! :D \\n So...slavery. It\\'s one of the most touchy words in the English language because...well.....it\\'s  slavery , right? And it\\'s an institution that\\'s been around for literally thousands of years. The Romans used slaves to an absolutely INCREDIBLE extent - one that would be mind-boggling to us today. You know how the Civil War was fought over slavery? Well ...in Rome, they were an integral part of society. However....strangely enough as it might seem, \"slave\" was a VERY general term. There was a MASSIVE difference between a \"house slave,\" or even a \"city slave\" and a slave who worked the fields, the mines, or the ships. The former were seen as soft and pampered by the rest, the hard-working, hard-bitten, short-lived slaves. The city slaves lived a relatively cushy life for slaves. They earned money, they could eventually buy their freedom, they were teachers, maids, butlers, messengers, bodyservants, cooks, etc. Essentially...for an analogy and perspective. They were the equivalent to people who are paid minimum wage today. Now, some slaves got more (such as the bodyservants to the aristocracy, the teachers, etc), while some got less (the bath slaves), but they all lived relatively cushy lives. These are the examples that people give when they want to convince you that Roman slavery was cushy and that the Romans were wonderful people who wore togas everywhere and were the bestest and most culturedest people. Well....THEN you look at the flip side. The other slaves. The ones who  kept fucking revolting for a reason. \\n These were the farm slaves. The slaves in the mines (Perspective on the mines of the Roman world. I say mines, you think....maybe a little mineshaft in the ground, etc? Well you\\'re SEVERELY underestimating the Romans when it came to industry. And when I say severely....their mining projects in Spain (for example) were unbelievable. Here\\'s a quote from Richard Miles\\'  Carthage Must Be Destroyed : \\n > Furthermore, in order to increase efficiency and production, new techniques were brought in from the eastern Mediterranean. Large numbers of slaves, controlled by overseers [Who were also slaves], did the manual labour. Underground rivers were redirected through tunnels and shafts, and new technology was used to pump water out of shafts. The process by which the metal ore was extracted was laborious. First the rock containing the silver ore, usually mixed with lead, was crushed in running water. It was then sieved, before going through the same process twice more. The ore was then put in a kiln so that the silver could be separated out from the stone and lead before being transported, often by river, to the main cities on the coast. [...] in the Roman period from the second century BC to the fifth century AD it was calculated that at any one time some 40,000 slaves toiled in the Spanish mines, producing 25,000 drachmas [ approximately  107,000 grams of silver] of profit a day. Indeed, the colossal scale of both the Punic and the Roman mining operations can be ascertained by the 6,700,000 tonnes of mainly silver slag found at Rio Tinto that can be dated to those periods. \\n I used that quote just to give you an idea of exactly  how  extensive that  one  mining operation was. Spain was not the only place that Rome mined, but it was certainly one of the biggest. Those 40,000 slaves that had to work those mines? Yeah, they didn\\'t live long. Here\\'s an ancient writer named Posidonius\\' take on that: \\n > Originally any private person without mining experience could come and find a place to work in these mines, and since the silver-bearing seams in the earth were conveniently sited and plentiful, they would go away with great fortunes. But later the Romans gained control of Spain, and now a large number of Italians have taken over the mines and accumulated vast riches as a result of their desire to make profits; what they did was buy a great number of slaves and hand them over to the men in charge of the mining operations... \\n > The men engaged in these mining operations produce unbelievably large revenues for their masters, but as a result of their underground excavations day and night they become physical wrecks, and because of their extremely bad conditions, the mortality rate is high; they are not allowed to give up working or have a rest, but are forced by the beatings of their supervisors to stay at their places and throw away their wretched lives as a result of these horrible hardships. Some of them survive to endure their misery for a long time because of their physical stamina or sheer will-power; but because of the extent of their suffering, they prefer dying to surviving. \\n Yeeeeeeeeah. Note that the  vast  majority of Roman slaves were not household, or even city slaves. They were mostly field slaves, under conditions like these. Here\\'s one about work in a flour mill - note, a work of fiction, but (As Charles Dickens showed), fiction is often based on fact. This is from Apuleius\\'  Metamorphoses : \\n > The men there were indescribable - their entire skin was coloured black and blue with the weals left by whippings, and their scarred backs were shaded rather than covered by tunics which were patched and torn. Some of them wore no more than a tiny covering around their loins, but all were dressed in such a way that you could see through their rags. They had letters branded on their foreheads, their hair had been partially shaved off, and they had fetters on their feet. They were sallow and discoloured, and the smoky and steamy atmosphere had affected their eyelids and inflamed their eyes. Their bodies were a dirty white because of the dusty flour - like athletes who get covered with fine sand when they fight. \\n Masters could essentially do whatever they wanted to slaves - some were more lenient (Seneca has writings on this in particular), while some (obviously) were more brutal. Interestingly enough, a middle ground would be the slaves who we find most interesting today...the infamous Roman gladiator. Like all other slaves, they were...well...slaves. They were subject to their master\\'s whims, they could...well...this piece of graffiti from the time period says it all: \\n > Take hold of your servant girl whenever you want to; it’s your right. \\n ^ That. Know what that means? Yeah, you can fuck your slave whenever you want - they\\'re a slave, it\\'s what slaves are for. Gladiators were used just like all the other slaves - except their use was also a blood sport. They (like other slaves) weren\\'t allowed to get married, however they kept the winnings from their fights. They were relatively pampered (fame and fortune - think sports superstars combined with Hollywood icons), however they were forced to fight for the entertainment of the Roman citizenry.

Han, Wei, Zhou, Yan, etc but he never unified the people thanks to his legalistic government structure which involved harsh laws and high levels of taxes amongst other things. Add that with forced labor for numerous projects such as the building of the Great Wall (which in actuality was basically reinforcing and connecting numerous walls that northern states had built to keep out the nomadic hordes [xiongnu]) along with things such as his crypt and you got a recipe for unrest. Though he did much good such as forcing all the conquered states to adhere to one written language and a common system of coinage / trade which simplified things (states had different values for currency which wildly varied from state to state) and somewhat 'united' the people. \\n Though I wouldn't say he was effective at keeping China unified. His reign was marked with constant rebellions from disgruntled peasants and clansman of the former royal families. As he got older, he got more paranoid and experimented with 'immortality' potions which further alienated more people. Upon his death, rebellions started popping up en masse until once again the entire state was at war with the reemergence of the former states such as Chu which were lead by former royal families. The rebellions of course toppled the Qin Dynasty which lasted a paltry ~20 years. \\n Then we got the Chu-Han contention between Liu Bang [Han] and Xiang Yu [Chu] which resulted in Liu bang being victorious and finally unifying the empire under one. Other than a mishap against the xiongnu which resulted in the Heqin policy (marriage of a royal princess to a Xiongnu leader to stop invasions), there was peace. And this peace lasted for over a hundred years until Emperor Wu (Liu Che) went to war with the Xiongnu in the late BC's and smashed them to pieces (while almost ruining the empire). \\n TLDR: I'd argue it was the Han Empire that successfully unified China (both states and people) and laid that foundations  that every successive dynasty built upon -- ala Centralized Government, unified language and trade,policy that favored intellectuals, projects that enhanced and expanded agriculture [see the canals] etc. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('Hi! Before I go into details and numbers, I’ll introduce you briefly to how it changed. \\n The Roman army was a great tool to conquer and Romanize other civilizations. Through it, the Roman Empire extended from Scotland to Jordan. But as Rome was not built in a day, Rome’s army also took centuries to organize and evolve. \\n From the beginning up until the second century BC, the Roman army was modeled on the census division of society. Most of the men were compelled to military service and equipped themselves how they could. Richest people traditionally formed the cavalry because they were able to maintain a horse for war. Then came the heavy infantry made of people with just enough money to live. At the bottom, the poor people were the light infantry (velites). As for the proletarians, they were not called because since they had nothing to defend, they could not show fighting spirit. \\n In 107 BC, under the consul Gaius Marius, the conscript army was gradually giving way to a more professional army. It was now open to the poorest, who enlisted massively. For these volunteers that came in vast majority from rural areas, the army is seen as a safe way to climb the social ladder. This reform was necessitated by the socio-political context of the time, and by a growing disaffection of the upper classes for the things of war. One consequence of this measure is the \"standardization\" of the equipment because it is from now on the State that supplies the soldiers with the equipment needed. \\n Under Caesar, a legion had approximately 4800 men (The number varies depending on what source you use. Some say it was composed of 5,400 while some say 6000).It was divided into 10 cohorts of 480 men (I to X). Each cohort had 3  maniple , divided each in 2 centuries of 80 legionnaires (X, Y). A century contains 10  contubernium , sleeping under the same tent. \\n At the end of the first century before BC, the army was undergoing a few changes. The first cohort, elite unit of the legion, now included 5 double-centuries, which was approximately 800 men. \\n The total theoretical number of a legion became 5200 combatants, assisted by a multitude of servants and [muleteers](   120 legionaries were selected to compose the cavalry, and serve as scouts and as express couriers. The soldiers supplied the main part of the jobs necessary for the life in autarky: pioneers, architects, doctors, qualified craftsmen, etc.\\nAfter the period of the civil wars, Octave returned the number of legions to 28, which is 150.000 men to defend the Empire. \\n The praetorian troops arose from the need which certain military leaders considered necessary and prestigious to establish (or constitute) a devoted personal guard. Their name comes from the fact that they usually planted their tents near the [praetorium]( \\n For the Praetorian Guard, Octave stopped their number at 4500 men, distributed in 9 troops, commanded by two prefects of the court. Three troops were established in Rome, and the other 6 around the city. Each of the praetorian troop assured (by rotation) to guard the palace.\\nRome has another 4 urban troops, in charge of the maintenance of law and order, and 7 [vigiles](  recruited among the emancipated slaves that act as fire brigades and as night police. \\n For the Auxiliary troops, they were recruited among non-citizens, for a duration of 25 years of service. At the end of their commitment, they usually received the right of citizenship to their children. They were distributed in troops of infantry (of 500 or 1000 men). Cavalry units had an equal number of soldiers, but distributed in 16 or 24 [turmas](  of 32 horses each.\\nLater on, there will also be mixed troops, consisted for three quarter of foot soldiers and for a quarter of riders, as well as native, called [numeris](  commanded by local leaders and equipped with their national armament. \\n And finally, for the marine, Octave created a navy made of eight squadrons and three  flotillas , in the Black Sea, in Manche and in the North Sea, in Fréjus in Gaul and in Libya. The flotillas also played an important role in the surveillance of the borders, by mostly assuring the protection of the convoys of troops and provisioning. They were distributed on the Rhine and on the Danube. \\n The service in the navy wasn’t popular and the Roman citizens avoid it. Its duration was of 26 years, at the end of which the non-citizens received the right of citizenship. Provinces supplied the main part of the recruits. \\n [Here’s a picture]( of the structure of a Roman legion. You can also see the letters that show how it was divided. \\n TL;DR It changed a lot. \\n',\n  0),\n ('> Also, was there a racial hierarchy? Were the pharaohs a different race than common people and slaves? \\n Well, firstly, what exactly do you mean by “Ancient Egyptians”? Since you mention the Pharaohs, I am assuming that you are referring to the Dynastic Period culture in the Nile Valley, (Pyramids, Sphinx, etc), and not the Pre-Dynastic period cultures which flourished in the Nile Valley beforehand. So, the period I’ll be talking about is from 3200 BC, or around the unification of the Upper and Lower Egypt, to 30 BC, when Egypt was finally overshadowed by Rome. \\n To deal with your question in the title, as to the reason why you see the appearance of the Ancient Egyptians differ in various media outlets, that’s more than likely because since the start of modern Egyptology (during Napoleon’s invasion of Egypt), there has been at least 1 attempt (and probably more) to attach the Ancient Egyptians to one culture or another. There’s the Caucasian Hypothesis, the Mesopotamian Hypothesis, The Asiatic Hypothesis, the Black Hypothesis, the Mixed Race Hypothesis, and so on. The reason for this is primarily the Dynastic Egyptians economic, architectural, and scientific achievements. Put bluntly, the Dynastic Egyptians built a bunch of really cool stuff, so everyone wants to claim them as their own. \\n The problem with this is that the concept of “Race” is a functionally useless term and has been pretty much abandoned by modern historical scholarship (with excellent reason, might I add).  Cultures and ethno-linguistic groups are the common rule of the day now, so trying to attach any one “race” to the Dynastic Egyptians is a fruitless exercise. \\n The Ancient Egyptians were not a “race”; as Yurco, Zakrzewski, Massoulard, Wilkinson, and other modern Egyptologists point out; they were culturally and linguistically contiguous group that arose around the Nile from pre-existing Pre-Dynastic cultures.  As the Pre-Dynastic culture populations increased, increasingly more sophisticated governing schemes and structures were called for; as their cultures, governments, and economies become more complex, you see the rise of what is today considered Upper and Lower Egypt, until their unification around 3150 BC, most probably by Narmer (although other possibilities exist.) \\n Now, since there was no real “race”, there was no real “racial hierarchy”. \\n EXCEPT…. \\n Ancient Egypt sat on probably the most important trade line out of Africa: The Nile. As such, during weak points during the Dynastic Period, Egypt was a rich target for invading foreign cultures.  There are several good examples of this, namely the invading Hyksos culture, who invaded Egypt and founded the 15th and 16th Dynastis, and Nubians, who invaded around the 25th Dynasty. In the case of the Hyksos Dynasties, there may well have been a cultural separation between the Hyksos overlords and their Native subjects. However, artifacts from the period indicate that the Hyksos Pharoahs attempted to “fit in” amongst their subjects but adopting large parts of the pre-existing culture. This wasn’t entirely effective, however, as the native Egyptian aristocracy would eventually mobilize and drive them out, thus starting the native run 17th Dynasty.  The Nubians, however, were not driven out by native resistance, but instead were driven out by Assurbanipal of the Assyrians, who then took over most of what is now Egypt and then established a bunch of client Kings to govern Egypt with his approval. That lasted a short time, however, before the Assyrians finally crumbled before the might of Persia, and the petty native Assyrian client dynasties of Egypt followed suit.  The Persians were firmly in control of Egypt until 332 B.C. In this case, there was definite instance of a wide social gulf between the natives and the Persian rulers; Herodotus and other Greek writers note in several instances that the ancient Egyptians were semi-notorious for being xenophobic; that combined with Persian economic policies towards that area meant that the native Egyptian aristocracy and lower social classes were very unhappy. Unhappy enough to greet the invading Greeks under Alexander the Great. The Greek Ptolemaic Dynasty of Egypt lasted until 30 BC, when it was finally smashed under Rome. \\n TL:DR : “Race” is a worthless term in terms of history. The Ancient Egyptians were a cultural and linguistic group that arose from pre-existing cultures in the Nile area. Their culture evolved and developed over the course of about 3000 years, until finally falling to Rome. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"Here's my question: if it's primarily xenophobia, then in a less xenophobic culture the Romani would do well; considering Romani cultural attitudes towards criminality and  gadzhe --outsiders--wouldn't there be a lot of  conflict with the locals if unassimilated Romani showed up in some obscure corner of Africa, Asia, or the Americas, even if said locals weren't particularly xenophobic?

During the early days of Mithradates of Pergamon: \"Mithridates orchestrated a massacre of Roman and Italian settlers remaining in several Anatolian cities, essentially wiping out the Roman presence in the region. This episode is known as the Asiatic Vespers\" He made alliances with the rulers all around him as he planned an all out war with the Roman Republic, they sent General Sulla to retaliate with a massive invasion force and he essentially took back greece from Pontus but he was criticised for his brutality, especially to Athens, which he practically destroyed. So that was an attempted Genocide of Romans. Sulla was fighting with Gaius Marius and Gaius Marius wanted to sign a peace treaty with Pontus to piss of Sulla and effectively leaving his army there so the Pontic forces could rally and destroy Sulla and yadda yadda yadda, it was all about Politics back in Rome.

While it is absolutely true that the CIA was funneling money and equipment to the Pakistani Intelligence service (ISI) who in turn was distributing it to the Mujahideen during the 1980s, the Mujahideen was not the same as the Taliban, and for that matter, there is an important delineation between the Afghan Mujahideen and the foreign Arab fighters who streamed into the country and included among their number bin Laden. \\n The most important thing to understand is that the Taliban were a creation of the 1990s, and the political instablity and infighting that resulted from the Soviets leaving and the Mujahideen being torn apart by internal disagreement. While former members of the Muj no doubt joined with the Taliban, the Taliban were not a successor organization, and in fact directly fought the Mujahideen and kicked the Muj backed government out of Kabul. And as for Osama bin Laden, no one disputes he was there, or building the infrastructure for what would become his terrorist organization Al Qaeda, but he was independently wealthy and funded by his personal fortune and donations from Wahabbist elements in the Persian Gulf (mainly Saudi Arabia).  The bulk  of sources agree that American funds were not going to him. ^[1] \\n The thing to understand is that during the \\'70s/\\'80s, there was a wide variety of forces opposing the Soviets and their Afghan puppet governments forces, and these opposition groups often were only slightly more friendly with each other than they were to the Communist forces, which is to say there was a lot of bad blood barely concealed below the surface. The groups did their best to work together, essentially forming two blocs. The more powerful one was the Islamic Unity, which was backed by Pakistan and the United States. They were formed by seven Sunni Mujahideen groups, all of which were Pashtun except for Jamiat-i-Islam, which was made up of ethnic Tajiks. There was also the so-called \"Tehran Eight\", which were eight (duh) Shia groups backed by Iran, and never all that powerful, at least in comparison. \\n When the Soviets finally withdrew, the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, led by Mohammad Najibullah, continued to fight against the Mujahideen in a losing battle. The dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end to its military support was the last straw. In early 1992, Ahmad Shah Massoud’s (An ethnic Tajik of Jamiat-i-Islam, and one of the best commanders of the Mujahideen, and also the favorite of the United States) forces closed on Kabul and took the city, sending Najibullah fleeing into the UN headquarters where he would live for the next four years. \\n Massoud became the defense minister of the new regime, but the power sharing agreement between the Mujahideen groups broke down as the moderates, led by Massoud, feuded with Islamic extremist elements led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and his Hezb-e Islami group. The ISI started out by backing Hekmatyar, as they had never had any love Massoud and his Tajiks, and believed Hekmatyar would be an easily controlled puppet for them to keep tabs on Afghanistan through. And with the abandonment of the ISI\\'s largesse, Massoud\\'s forces suddenly found themselves yesterday\\'s news with the end of the Cold War. While ostensibly still the favorite of the USA, most of the funding had been going through the ISI, and anyways, with Russia gone Afghanistan just wasn\\'t a priority. So what was one a fire hydrant of help was now more like a small garden hose at best. \\n Despite the set back though, Massoud was able to fight off Hekmatyar effectively enough, but the war ravaged the already injured nation further, and the countryside descended into lawlessness, with every warlord carving out his little fief and running it how he wanted. Enter stage right the Taliban. The origin story is that one of the local criminals/warlords had set up a roadblock, at which his men abducted two teenage girls to rape. A local religious leader named Mullah Omar organized a group of men who went and rescued the girls, and executed the ringleader. In the abject state of lawlessness then reigning in Afghanistan, the appeal of the swift justice brought about by the Taliban, as Omar\\'s group became known, quickly caused the number of his followers to swell. Preaching a very fundamentalist brand of Islam, he especially appealed to the young generation of Afghans who had spent their youth in Pakistan being educated in Wahhabist funded madrassahs (the large number of students which made up the early ranks is the source of the name, Taliban translating to student). \\n We\\'re tiptoeing around the 20 year rule now, but following the fall of Najibullah\\'s government, as I said, Massoud was able to keep Hekmatyar at bay. In 1994, with the rise of the Taliban, the ISI got tired of Hekmatyar and mostly abandoned him in favor of this new power, who had been fighting against both the government (former Mujahideen) forces and Hekmatyar. Now without support, Hekmatyar was quickly defeated (well, it is more complicated than that, but not all that material to this, and violated the 20 year rule more than I would like to do), and Massoud found a new problem on his hands as the Taliban was now in control of a good portion of the country. Attempts to integrate them into some sort of unity government failed, and the end result was the Taliban taking Kabul in 1996, and Massoud fleeing for the mountains where he would found the Northern Alliance to continue the fight against them.

But that was 2500 years ago. \\n Cyrus the Great (actually pronounced  Kurosh  in Persian) had a knack for overthrowing ancient kings. He was originally a king of Pārsā (Persis), a southern province of the Empire of the Medes. Cyrus, along with the Median general Harpagus, started a rebellion against the Medes. Emerging as the victor, Cyrus established a united Iranian empire under the Achaemenid dynasty. (1) \\n Threatened by the growing Achaemenid power, king Croeseus of Lydia (an ancient Indo-European kingdom in modern-day Turkey) was threatened by the increasing Persian power. According to Herodotus, the famous oracle of Delphi told him that a great kingdom would fall if he attacked Persia. Croeseus took over the Persian city of Pteria. Cyrus tried to encourage the Ionian Greek to overthrow Croeseus; because they were allies of the Lydians, they refused. Cyrus then took the overthrowing into his own hands and invaded Lydia. According to Herodotus, \"they made trial of one another by force of arms in the land of Pteria: and after hard fighting, when many had fallen on both sides, at length, night having come on, they parted from one the other with no victory on either side.\" (2) In the final battle, [Cyrus used an interesting technique.]( \\n Now Cyrus turns his attention to the Babylonians. The Babylonians had previously been allies of the Iranians, when the Medes and Chaldeans united to overthrow the common enemy of Assyria. However, Babylonia and Persia came into conflict, with Cyrus capturing Elam. (3) A Babylonian army defected to Cyrus (don\\'t have my copy of Farrokh with me so I can\\'t find specifics), and Cyrus was able to bloodlessly march into the heart of Babylon. Nabonidus was supposedly unpopular at the time, and the Persians took Babylonian territory without resistance. (4) Nabonidus fled back to Babylon. In the siege of the city, Cyrus said the ancient equivalent of \"I\\'ll make this river my bitch\" and built an elaborate canal system to divert the river and wade past the natural defenses. (5) Nabonidus was taken prisoner, and the Persians took over the entire Neo-Babylonian Empire. (6) \\n Things go pretty well. The Persians have a pretty lax policy towards local religions, and do not enslave conquered populations. Territory from Byzantion to Bactra is incorporated in the largest and wealthiest empire in the world. The new Persian order is particularly loved by the Jewish people, who had been liberated from Babylonian captivity. (7) In the Old Testament alone, Cyrus: is called a messiah (8), makes proclamations inspired by God (9), is raised to righteousness by God (10), finances the rebuilding the temple (11), orders the rebuilding of the temple (12), organizes the rebuilding of the temple (13), is the shepherd of God (14), and is made king by God himself (15). (There\\'s probably a lost gnostic gospel out there claiming that Cyrus was Jesus himself.) Cyrus issues his famous Cyrus Cylinder, a declaration of repatriation of scattered peoples (16). While Iranian nationalists like to claim that it was the world\\'s first \"human rights charter,\" it was in fact very common for Mesopotamnian kings to claim their benevolence towards popular religions. But the Jewish histories (don\\'t worry, it\\'s not another Bible verse) seem to support an actual policy of religious tolerance in the Empire. (17) Cyrus is mentioned as a great ruler in the  Histories  of Herodotus, the  Kuropaidia  ( Cyropedia ) of Xenophon, and other Greek histories. [Not bad.]( \\n As /u/Daeres will undoubtedly tell you, the Persians didn\\'t fly around spewing rainbows and butterflies. Later Persian kings weren\\'t as benevolent or loved universally. One inscription at Persepolis talks about the destruction of \"demonic\" temples (18) - a departure from the religious tolerance policy - which is confirmed by the plundering and burning of Greek temples (19)(20), and the frequent abuse of Egyptian temples (21). Persian rule was very unpopular in Egypt, and the Egyptians often revolted against entering Persian armies. Speaking of revolts, there were major internal rebellions under Cambyses, Darius, and Xerxes. So much for stability. But overall, Persia succeeded in overthrowing foreign dictators and installing stable governments throughout its reign. \\n tl;dr Persians do in Babylonia what George Bush failed to.

Therefore, considering the availability of alternative perspectives during the Renaissance, Foucault’s observation applies, with seeming certainty, only to those who state so themselves—e.g., Marsilio Ficino (1433-1499), Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463-1494), Paracelsus the Great (1493-1541), Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim (1486-1535), and Giordano Bruno (1548-1600).[7] \\n My question is this: If \"it is not possible to act upon those marks without at the same time operating upon that which is secretly indicated by them,\" then what were the alchemists doing when they acted upon those marks by writing enigmatic texts full of obscuring analogies? \\n In other words, for many alchemists during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, the act of using symbols to describe alchemical experiments  was  the experiment--i.e., the texts themselves  are  the experiments, not just the experiments described by the texts. \\n If an alchemist honestly believes he has the power to change things by manipulating the symbols for them, does it not follow suit that he also believes he is changing things by simply writing about changing them? \\n [6] Michel Foucault, The Order of Things.

Bischoff said that he would join on one condition, that he would get all of the land of the tribe a few miles over from the town.  The British agreed and Bischoff served in the army. \\n After the war was over he asked the British for assistance getting the Indians off of the land that they had promised him.  The British laughed and told Bischoff that he was an idiot and that they never actually meant for him to take the land.  So Bischoff then gets his children (by this time all seven of his sons were fully grown) and proceeds to kill all of the Native Americans on what he thought was his land. \\n I'm not sure why but the British turned a blind eye to this.

Britain had a naval, and  very arguably  air advantage over Germany, but that\\'s about it. At the time, a coastal invasion of France would be downright impossible if Germany had full strength in the area. D-Day was bloody enough already, and Germany had only a small fraction of its forces on France at the time. \\n But then, Barbarossa came. There\\'s not a general consensus as to when was the turning point of the war. The majority of the scholars like to point to Stalingrad. David Glantz says it\\'s Kursk. Others, most notably the author of Moscow 1941 (forgot his name), even say that the war was basically won when Germany failed to conquer Moscow at the end of 1941. However, all of them agree that the war was won in the east. If the soviets had capitulated at the end of 1941 (a possibility that crossed Stalin\\'s mind according to Glantz), WWII would be effectively over. \\n The fact is, that the American and British contribution in the war up until 1944 was very limited. The German failure at the battle of Britain tied up some Luftwaffe divisions in France and Germany, but not nearly enough compared to what was deployed in the eastern front. The allied Northwest African invasion was badly planned, badly executed, and overall achieved almost nothing except for displaying Rommel\\'s talent as a commander, and for holding the Suez canal, which was useless for the USSR. The Italian campaign is frankly hilarious to read about (I recommend \"A Day of Battle\"), since the Allies chose arguably the worst place and terrain in Europe to launch a naval invasion. The blunders in the Italian campaign are fairly well documented and I recommend further reading in the subject. Suffice to say that the campaign was, at best, a bloody stalemate, and at worst, an enormous waste of resources and manpower against an enemy which was clearly not the main threat, in an inhospitable terrain that could be easily defended. Even if they had conquered Italy fast (they didn\\'t; the Italian front collapsed only in 1945), the Alps would stall any further advance into Europe. \\n And then we have D-Day. While the invasion of France was not as full of blunders as the others, it just came too late to actually matter. By June 1944, everybody and their mother knew that the Reich would fall. It was a matter of \"when\", not \"if\". Bagration was in the USSR\\'s plans for a while. Hitler was already in \"full retard\" mode, ignoring his generals advice, ordering the generals to defend ground until the last man, etc. The fact is that the combined effect of the failures in Moscow, Leningrad and especially Stalingrad and Kursk crippled the Reich too much, while USSR\\'s industry and army only got stronger. Kursk (which was in 1943) is generally regarded as the last turning point of the war; after that, no one realistically thinks that Germany had any chance anymore. \\n If anything, D-Day\\'s objective was not to win the war; it was already won by the time the Allies set foot in France. It served to liberate France, not only from the Germans, but from the Soviet steamroller which would eventually reach there. Assuming that D-Day fails, the whole of Europe would be red by WWII\\'s end. \\n TL;DR: the first contributions of the western Allies were minor, and by the time they set foot in France, WWII was already won, the only remaining question being who would get the spoils. \\n',\n  0),\n ('I think what /u/Tiako said sums it up perfectly. One of my favorite examples is the tragedy between the American Indians and Europeans. The natives, as we know, suffered tremendously at the hands of the explorers during colonization. Additionally, most of the literature about Native Americans is sensationalized, often portraying them as a group in need of salvation and conquering or as exotic case studies. That is one of the reasons, in Spanish exploration at least, the crown sent increasing numbers of conquistadores and friars to the New World. As far as I know, there are more examples of literature from the colonization era that portray natives negatively than positively. However we have people like Bartolome de las Casas who wrote  A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies  that shed some light on what actually went on during Spanish campaigns (Note- one should take his works with a grain of salt. He wrote a first-hand account of the Cortez campaign in Mexico [1521 I believe] despite not actually being there). Works like this influenced King Philip II to make laws that prohibited governors in the New World from brutality, though whether they abided by them is another story. \\n TL;DR: as /u/Tiako said, evaluate each work on its own merits. Most history is written with bias, hence the notion that the winners write history. Given my example however, does anyone have suggestions for early Native American histories that are written with as neutral of a stance as possible? \\n',\n  0),\n ('Let\\'s talk about pianistic sabotage. \\n In his early 20s,  Beethoven  (already a very good pianist) was trying to break into the musical scene in Vienna (not an easy thing to do, neither in his days nor ours).

As Richard Gott discussed in his book  Cuba: A New History , 42K troops, 50 aircraft, 12 submarines, and dozens of conventional and nuclear missiles would be brought secretly into Cuba.  Cuban questioning was simply waved away with the Soviets citing their \"expertise in such matters.\"  The Soviets seemingly went all out trying to prove their prowess in such matters with military hero Marshall Sergei Biryuzov taking Raul Castro on a tour of the island.  Biryuzov explained how and where the missiles would be placed, explained how the new equipment would function, and discussed the amount of Soviet troops that would be need accommodation.

This lead Ernesto Guevara, who, along with Raul Castro, largely built the relationship with the Soviet Union, to begin denouncing the USSR almost as frequently as the United States.  Jon Lee Anderson really drives this home in his book about Guevara, wherein the iconic revolutionary laments that the missiles were not in Cuban control, because they would have used them. \\n This caused a strain on the relationship between Cuba and the Soviet Union with the Castro brothers fighting Soviet influence from without and within while still attempting to get help from the Soviet Union as a fellow communist country.

Or that \"Viking Metal\" even exists. But they do... This is called \"social reality\". If you deny the existence of the state of Israel, does it still exist? Or that the US dollar is worth what it is worth? This kind of existence depends on whether it is accepted or not. If people say there\\'s an Israel, that the US dollar is worth this much, that Nerdcore isn\\'t G-Funk then... well... I guess it\\'s both true and not true. \\n 3) So, suppose the difference between a given genre and another genre is that the subject matter is more political, or darker. And the instruments less electrified and distorted. Maybe the singing is less in tune - a bit hoarse. But you can find such differences in classical music easily. Classical music has so much variety, it\\'s incredibly hard to even know where to start. The way the great composers will come up with a melody, cut it to pieces, re-arrange it, put it over different harmonies, on different instruments, at half speed, double speed, change keys, once... twice... move on to COMPLETELY different sections of music and maybe, just maybe at the end, they\\'ll give you a little taste of that familiar melody again just before they finish the piece of music. Ah... (And that\\'s just [a single] melody!)  Sadly, this is where the lack of in depth music analysis can lead to assumptions that classical music isn\\'t varied.  Furthermore, when we look at classical music, often it is just to study it, so ironically since there\\'s so much diversity, we actually need to SIMPLIFY the groupings. Added to that, the fact that Classical Music can be cut up merely by things like ensemble used (choral, chamber, string quartet), the composer (often, you\\'ll speak only of Beethoven\\'s work, for example, in a way that contemporary singer/songwriters are not regarded, as if he is a genre of his own). \\n tl;dr? It might be that there\\'s a \"trend\" to label music styles, but since we look BACK on classical music, the traditions of what the genres of classical music are, are already in place. There\\'s no need to cut it into tiny pieces either for marketing or for self-identification, just because a genre \"exists\" doesn\\'t make it more or less valid or informative of the style of music, indeed, it might be more of a reflection of the social forces around it and the related dances/clothing etc. AND there seems to be a huge under-estimation of the vitality and diversity of classical music, which is mind-boggling varied and complex - the way one can\\'t even fathom how big the universe is. \\n This is more of a discussion, so maybe this response belongs elsewhere? \\n',\n  0),\n ('Well, the simple answer is \"we don\\'t always.\" \\n That being said, if you have something that\\'s referred to in multiple different primary sources, you can be  reasonably  sure that it went down that way.

However, it was on this day that a new currency (the Deutsche Mark) was introduced in the newly formed West Germany. \\n Because of this currency reform in West Germany, there was an obvious implication: the currency in West Berlin had also been changed. Combined with the fact that, at this point in time, people were still moving freely between East and West Berlin, this currency reform in the West had huge economic repurcussions in the East (and was one of the reasons why the infamous Berlin Blockade happened). The problem was that East Berlin still used the old currency. This meant that all the (now worthless) Rentenmark and Reichsmarks from West Berlin flooded the Soviet occupation zone, causing massive inflation. This sparked the Soviets into eventually doing what had already been proposed: changing the currency of East Berlin. This new currency was introduced on 24th July 1948, and was also called the Deutsche Mark, however in the West it was known as the Ostmark or East Mark. \\n TL;DR: June 1948 in West Germany, and 24th July 1948 in East Germany. \\n Sources: \\n Also, I just finished studying this at university. \\n Edit: missed out the day the Deutsche Mark was introduced in West Germany. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"I'm just greatful I didn't get an insta-ban.

Attacking the US and the UK at once certainly wasn\\'t the logical conclusion to their colonial empire. Neither was the way in which the conquest was conducted. For instance, in WWI the Japanese were cited by the Red Cross for their exemplar care of POWs while in WWII mortality rate in Japanese POW camps was the highest of any country in the war IIRC. \\n To make a comparison, Germany was more radicalized in WWII even though the war they fought in 1939-1945 was similar strategically to the one they fought in 1914-1918 (both entailing conquest of large parts of the Russian/Soviet Empire as a part of a two front war etc). Similarly, Japan was more radicalized even though the wars it fought was in part a logical continuation of the previous colonial wars they fought. The Japanese government went in the interbellum from what amounted to a sort of a democracy to a full-blown out autocratic government during the war. The conquests they made were explicitly based something which was similar to the Lebensraum ideology the Nazis justified their conquest with. Japan was allied with the UK in WWI and wouldn\\'t have even thought of starting war with the UK/US at the same time. The way they viewed the Chinese and the other peoples they conquered in the same way the Nazis viewed Slavs. The treatment of Koreans also got dramatically worse during the 30s and 40s. In the end, there was no equivalent of the rape of Nanking in WWI. \\n So why did they become radicalized? Let\\'s start with the year 1919. The answer is actually remarkable similar to why the Germans and Italians were radicalized.  First of all, Japan felt cheated at Versailles , most of all, it felt humiliated when it introduced a clause at Versailles calling for acknowledgement of racial equality in the world and got it thrown back into their face by the other nations there. This is similar (though for other reasons) to the resentment Italians felt with regards to the \"mutilated victory\" and the Germans regarding the Versailles \"diktat\". It also made the Japanese overcompensate for the humiliation by seeing themselves as the \"Master Race\" of Asia. \\n The other probably even more important answer, like in the German case, is  the Great Depression  of the 1930s. The depression first of all discredited liberal Capitalist Democracy in Japan, which seems unable to resolve the economical crisis. This turned the Japanese people against the Taisho democracy of the 1920s. This era also planted the idea that wars of expansion and the settlement of conquered territory with \"Yamoto blood\" (and other, similar racial ideas) as the solution to economical woes. It also drove right-wing terrorism from within the military against the civilian government, which was perceived as corrupt and weak and the cause for suffering of millions of Japan\\'s poorest. \\n Which brings us to the  radicalization of the military  in the 20s and 30s. And how it became a nearly autonomous entity which basically dictated Japan\\'s foreign policy. Besides the mentioned depression, there was also the  Washington and London Naval Treaties , which, signed by Japan\\'s government, limited the size of Japan\\'s Navy and which the military saw as leaving the country unable to defend itself. Which further turned the military against the civilian government. Which manifested itself both as the military started to act increasingly independently and in attacks on the civilian government. \\n The acts of terrorism from within the military culminated in the assassination of Japanese Prime minister Inukai Tsuyoshi in 1932, and the attempted coup d\\'etat of Feb 26 1936. Those acts cowed both the Japanese civilian government and the emperor himself. The Japanese Kwantung army, acting in collaboration with the industrial conglomerates called Zaibatsu (which controlled much the economy) was basically conducting it\\'s own foreign policy without input from Tokyo, most notably in the war in Manchuria and later China. In a manner far more brazenly aggressive than Japan\\'s civilian government ever was before, in terms of disregard for international opinion, the brutality of the conquests, and the size of the territory taken. \\n Which brings us to the last point, which takes place in the late 30s and early 40s, which was  the war in China itself . The war in China consumed resources like oil at a massive rate, the US then enacted an oil embargo against Japan in 1940 in response to the Japanese occupation of Indochina (which itself was due to the idea that China was being supplied by the west through Vietnam). The Japanese had no domestic source of oil, and its stocks would run out in a couple of years, which meant it had to accept \"defeat\" in a war which was already a stalemate in China. So at this point, Japan faced the prospect of either war with the UK/US/Holland to seize oil producing territories (like the Dutch East Indies), or decline in power in the future. And thus why the Japanese launched their most radical war ever. \\n TL;DR: The Japanese did become more radicalized after WWI, it was because of the Great Depression, a humiliation at Versailles, the Washington Naval Treaty, and the War in China further radicalized an already radicalized Japan \\n',\n  0),\n (\"I'm sorry, but I have to agree with the other posters - I haven't heard such absurd and either extremely ignorant or extremely manipulative theory in a long time. People before me made a lot of excellent points, so I wanted to focus on the stuff that wasn't mentioned so much. \\n First of all, I'm from Eastern Europe. I was just a kid when communism collapsed, but I experienced enough to find the idea that the economic and political system I was born to and the one in which I live right now are even remotely similar completely mindboggling. \\n First of all, I can find no benefits of living in Soviet Union and I don't think you will find many people who would like to live there again - unless you speak to some Russians nostalgic for imperialist glory. And here you have two basic differences - first of all, the European Union has no imperialist ambitions. Mind you, there are politicians who think Europe should play a bigger role in the international politics, but the EU doesn't have an army or a common foreign policy (we are speaking about it. We have been doing that for the last few decades and it doesn't look like Europe is going to have a common foreign policy or an army anytime soon). Today the EU consists of 27 countries with very different political interests. Poland wants the EU to focus on democracy in Ukraine and Belarus. France is insisting that countries like Tunisia or Algieria are much more important to Europe. Great Britain is still not sure if the whole joining thing has been a good idea and doesn't want to get too involved. Germany wants everybody to play nice, start being responsible for their economies and stop coming to Berlin for money. See what I mean? The EU countries are quarreling and negotiating about every little and big thing ALL THE TIME. And that doesn't even start to cover the complications that come with the fact, that all the member countries have their own inside politics, different parties, conflicts and elections, which all influence their behaviour and opinions concerning the EU. \\n You can't compare this to Soviet Union where there was no debate, no quarrels - you did what Moscow told you or you suffered. I really would like you to show me the EU's equivalent of gulags. How would the Soviet Union treat a member? Actually worse then a non-member. As bad as living behind the Iron Curtain in countires like East Germany or Poland was, life in actual Soviet Union was much harder. Just ask Ukrainians about Holodomor. \\n Then we are coming to the economy. As others pointed out, there really is no comparison. Maybe you see some similarities in facts like healthcare provided by the state, but it is only a similarity on the most of superficial levels. First of all, forget financial aid in Soviet Union. Or unemplyment benefits. You got public, free schools, unis, healthcare and pensions. Unempoyment was at times illegal and punishable by prison. When it was not, there was no help from the state. If you were poor, then it was your problem. For all the ideology, the Soviet Union was actually very bad place for poor people. Granted, in the first few decades of it's existence it was a very dangerous place for the more affluent as well. \\n Now, the EU. First of all, each of the 27 member states has different policies regarding healthcare, welfare, financial aid, education, wages, unemployment and immigration. All of them are much nicer to live in than Soviet Union ever was, hands down. The EU has budget from which it supports education, research, agriculture, NGOs and infrastructure in all member states. It is NOT a state, it is a common initiative by states which recognised that in a lot of cases money is better used when spent on bigger, regional and not just national level. The goal is to make the countries who are members more prospeous and the differences between the poor and the rich less stark. The EU doesn't have a governemnt, it has officials responsible for running the international organisation with huge budget and big administartion. All the decisions have to be approved by each of the member state - depending on their internal rules, either by the government, the parliament or by a popular vote like in Ireland. You ask how ACTA happened - why don't you ask why it didn't become the law? Because after the protests started some of the member states said they won't sign it. It didn't matter that some other already did. \\n TL;DR I', sorry for the long post, the topic was the one I'm really passionate about.

This is not how communist collectivism works. \\n Just because the EU is not as gung-ho about capitalism (with the exception of the City of London - note that this isn't London I'm talking about but the square mile) as the US, it doesn't make it some authoritarian communist whatever. \\n Did your source cite their sources for their statement?

Medicare is a socialist policy, so is unemployment benefit. So are roads, parks, education and anything else administered by the government be it city, county, state or federal government (clear up after hurricane Katrina for example). Socialism has become a dirty word in the US (Yeah, thanks for that McCarthy). The principles of socialism is the same as buying insurance. It's a rainy day fund. Socialised medicine for example. I'll put some of my wages by just in case I get some horrible debilitating disease. If I don't spend it, great I've not got some horrid chronic condition, if I do spend it, also great because if I run out of the money I've saved, someone else's contributions will top up mine and they don't mind because they haven't got said horrid disease. But this insurance company is better than a private fund, because all of this money goes to treating the sick (with some administration) and none of it is taken out to go to pay shareholders/board members etc. \\n Don't forget that there are vast amounts of money at stake in the medical industry in the US. Other healthcare systems don't have as many vested interests as the US (although the British government is currently trying to screw the British people out of their healthcare system to replace it with a medical industry). So money is at stake for the Richie Riches in the US, they don't want more socialised medicine as it is more efficient (3x the amount spent in the US compared to EU and Canada for equivalent standards of care - I think this is right, anyone have the source?), and will take money away from them (profiteering from the sick, really?).

Aside from their own steppe credentials, the Qing also actively recruited Mongol generals - such as [Sengge Rinchen]( who commanded the Qing forces in the 2nd Opium war. \\nSo, for TL;DR - Steppe peoples in the case study of China, presented above, were  a consistent existential threat  to the Han-based Chinese civilization.

But that gives a nice TL;DR to what I was looking for \\n',\n  0),\n ('This is a very good question! The period you are talking about is what I studied the most, but as Latin culture in the East isn\\'t very well researched at all, I can only give you a general overview. \\n Before the \"fall\" of the West, I think it is reasonable to say that Latin was widely spread in the East. In the fourth century we have Ammianus Marcellinus, an excellent historian from Antioch who made his name in Rome by writing a Latin history. In the early fifth century, we have Claudian, an Egyptian who became the court poet at the court of Honorius. Evidently, a Latin education was possible in the East. Similarly, we have sources such as the  Theodosian Code , which is a Latin codification of Roman laws commissioned in Constantinople, and many translations of ecclesiastical works, implying the existence of a vigorous Latin culture in the East. Greek was useful for understanding philosophy and some of the best rhetorical teachers (such as Libanius of Antioch) spoke Greek, so many Latin-speakers would have wanted to learn Greek. Even prominent Latin writers, such as Augustine of Hippo, were disappointed and looked down upon for not knowing Greek. After all, most ecclesiastical writers, such as Jerome and Rufinus, were bilingual and regularly travelled across the Roman world to learn from prominent holy men/women. The same would be true for secular writers, as there is a law from Valentinian that funded a Greek teacher in the imperial capital of Trier in Gaul, \\'if one can be found\\', which for me implies that many people wanted to learn Greek and that presumably those who can afford it simply travelled to the East.  Thus, I think it is fair to say that Latin and Greek co-existed amongst the educated class, and that if you were such a person in the East, even if Latin was less prestigious, there\\'s a good chance you would know it or have friends who did. Latin was still the official language of state in the Later Roman Empire, so any aspiring bureaucrat would have had a basic grasp of the language. \\n In the sixth century, it gets a bit more iffy, but I think Latin was still an important language. There is definitely a large Latin-speaking population in Illyricum, hence why Justin I and Justinian were native-speakers of Latin, and there was still a large Latin-speaking community in Constantinople. There were exiles from Africa and Italy in the capital, including prominent figures such as Anicia Juliana, an imperial princess (of the West) who sponsored Latin writers. One of them was Marcellinus Comes, who was also from Illyricum and served as the secretary to Justinian, and in turn wrote a pro-Justinian history in Latin - evidently, there was enough of an audience for a Latin history in Constantinople! Then we have the  Justinianic Code , which was again first issued in Latin, but then again, it might only be in Latin because the laws it collected was in Latin and it was quicker to leave them untranslated (the entire codification process took only three years), and perhaps because it looked good to the Western audience Justinian sought to appease. In any case, later laws under Justinian were in Greek. Latin was still used in state though, as based on John Malalas, an ex-bureaucrat from Antioch who wrote a chronicle after his retirement (in the 550s), Latin terms were still widely used in the administration. At the end of Justinian\\'s reign, there was also the court poet Corippus, who wrote several Latin panegyrics for the emperor and his successor, indicating that a Latin-speaker can still find success in the East. \\n Lastly, we have evidence from letters of Pope Gregory the Great, who served as a papal ambassador to Constantinople in the late sixth century. He admitted that he didn\\'t know any Greek, yet he made many friends at court (including the family of the emperor Maurice) and debated with the Ecumenical Patriarch over theological matters, which is generally viewed as evidence that there were enough Latin-speakers in Constantinople to ensure that an ambassador didn\\'t need to master Greek in order to do his job. My knowledge fails me in the seventh century as I can\\'t think of any Easterners who wrote in Latin, but I do know that many Greek-speaking holy men did travel across the Mediterranean and that in Rome at least, there was a large Greek-speaking population of monks and exiles, reinforcing my view that there was still a great deal of bilingualism around. At the very least, I know that Greek-speaking monks such as John Moschus, Sophronius and Maximus Confessor were able to find allies in both the East and the West in their quest to bring down miaphysitism/monotheletism, in Maximus\\' case even instigating a revolt in Africa and a rebellious synod in Rome. \\n tl;dr: Latin probably did decline by the seventh century because there was less need for it (the Byzantines lost Spain, Africa and direct control of Italy within a few decades), but there were still people around, particularly in the Church, who were bilingual and able to facilitate exchanges of ideas between the two cultures. Let me know if you have any questions about the writers I mentioned :) \\n',\n  0),\n ('The Polish Home Army (Armia Krajowa - AK) was a formidable fighting force in 1944, and while they were  principally  opposed to the Nazi occupiers of Poland, their relationship with the Soviet Union was at best at cautious one for obvious reasons. The Soviets, after all, had invaded Poland too in 1939! There were clashes (and cooperation) between the Home Army (which was aligned more with the Western Allies, and connected to the government-in-exile in London) and Communist backed groups, but the Communist groups were tiny in comparison to the nearly half-million member force that the Home Army had raised! \\n With the Soviets advancing from the east into Poland in 1944 though, cooperation became more common, at least on the face of it. When the Soviets were  apparently  within striking distance of Warsaw, the Home Army decided to rise up and openly contest German occupation of the city. A major reason for this was that they wanted to liberate it themselves, not be liberated by the Soviets. However, they believed that while they were going to be taking the initiative, the Soviets would at least show up and provide backup soon. In this, they were sorely mistaken. \\n Like I said, the Soviets may have been playing nice to the Pole\\'s faces at that time, but their underlying opinion had changed little. The Soviets viewed the AK as a direct threat to their goal of hegemony over Poland in the post-war era. For a little background to better understand the underlying situation, we can look back to before the USSR even invaded Poland, and to the purges of the 1930s. Ethnic Poles were some of the worst treated during the purges, and seen as enemies of the state. 143,810 were arrested, and 111,091 executed. According to Beevor\\'s \"Second World War\", this rate was  40  times higher than the average. \\n Following the invasion of 1939 and prior to being pushed out in 1941, the Soviets quickly moved to reshape eastern Poland into a pliant vassal. At Katyn Forest the Soviet NKVD executed roughly 8,000 officer POWs and about as many other notable persons (Not a historical source, but I would recommend watching the Polish film Katyn if you are interested in that bit of history). Aside from the executions, some 110,000 people were arrested to be sent mostly to labor camps. These were mostly anyone seen as a possible enemy of the Soviet mindset - doctors, lawyers, petite bourgeoisie, nationalists in general, etc. \\n It is also worth noting, of course, that the Soviets totally denied doing any of this. After Barbarossa, Katyn Forest came under German control, and they uncovered the mass grave. Of course, they quickly publicized their discovery and brought in neutral observers from the Red Cross to verify that it had occurred during the period of Soviet Occupation. The Soviets denied it and claimed the Germans were trying to smear them, and the Western Allies, not wanting to provoke a major ally (USSR) to appease a minor one (Poland), just kind of avoided the issue, and nodded their heads at the Soviets and told the Polish government-in-exile to not harp on the matter. Following the end of the war, no further investigation really happened and the massacre was casually mentioned at Nuremberg but not as a major charge, and it wasn\\'t until the 1990s that Soviet archives revealed the truth, and Russia admitted what had happened and apologized. An two-part article I have from the 1970s offers an interesting glimpse into the matter - it has a Western writer who kind of  implies  the Soviets did it, but really just lays out the evidence and tells you to make up your own mind; and then a Soviet author write the counter-point article with the disturbing conclusion that,  \"Thus was unmasked the provocative act of the Nazis, thus was established with complete clarity the fact of the monstrous killing by the Nazi authorities of Polish prisoners of war at Katyn Wood.\" \\n I\\'m digressing though, the point is, that the Soviets were incredibly harsh towards Poland, not just in mass executions and arrests, but also deporting 140,000 civilians in their occupation region far east over the Urals. The aim of this strategy was to gut Poland of any meaningful resistance to Soviet control. And while they were soon after kicked out by Germany, that didn\\'t really change their outlook. \\n So now we return to 1944, with the Soviets a hop, skip, and a jump away from Warsaw, and the AK rising up in force to take the city. Except as you probably know, the uprising failed, and Warsaw was utterly flattened, with hundreds of thousands of Poles - both fighters and civilians - dead. The Soviets barely lifted a finger in support. The big question is \"WHY!?\" \\n There are two schools of thought, which in my opinion are not necessarily mutually exclusive. The standard explanation from the Soviet side is that they had been advancing hard, and were spread out and exhausted. The men needed to rest before another major operation could begin, and forces needed to be re-provisioned and reinforced (you\\'ll find this argument in Zhukov\\'s memoirs, along with almost any other Soviet history). Plus, the AK didn\\'t coordinate with the Soviets very well, and if they had, could have timed the uprising better. So basically, the Soviet view puts the blame on the Poles for losing, and absolves themselves of responsibility by saying they couldn\\'t have helped no matter how much they wanted to. And there is  some  merit to this position. The uprising was on the tail end of Operation Bagration, so it is certainly true the Soviet had been going balls-to-the-wall earlier on. \\n But nevertheless, it isn\\'t an explanation that sits well. The flipside argument is that the Soviets purposefully let the uprising fail. The reasons for this should be obvious I think, since it would (and did) severely weaken the AK, reducing their ability to resist the Soviets following \"liberation\" of Poland. And there is plenty of evidence for this. Stalin\\'s personal statements about the rising were pointedly anti-Pole, and the Western Allies were denied the right to use Soviet airspace in supply-drops that they made, which meant planes had to make long round-trip flights as opposed to one-way hops finishing in Soviet territory. \\n The one thing that we lack though is the explicit order from Stalin that states not to advance on Warsaw until the AK is defeated. There is a very clear pattern of anti-Polish behavior and rhetoric that allows us to infer this motivation, but that\\'s the best we can do. In the end, it isn\\'t really as if the two positions are mutually exclusive though. Just because the Soviet Armies were spent at the time doesn\\'t mean that Stalin wasn\\'t  also  ecstatic at the prospect of the AK destroying itself of course, and even more than that, just because the Armies had been in heavy fighting for the past few months doesn\\'t mean that, if necessary, they couldn\\'t have made that extra push had the command been more inclined. \\n So anyways, from August 1st, 1944 through the next two months, the Polish Home Army fought valiantly, and in vain, to liberate Warsaw, and failed. The failure was a devastating blow. Not only was the city in ruins now, but some of the best fighters in the AK now lay dead or in German hands, and hundreds of thousands of civilians (those who weren\\'t killed in the fighting of course) now were expelled from the city, many going to concentration and extermination camps. It wasn\\'t until January, 1945 that the Soviets finally reached Warsaw, and they ordered the Home Army disbanded, which it did rather than resist. It was clear that the Western Allies were not going to press the issue for a free and  non -Soviet dominated Poland, which certainly disheartened many. Not all of them laid down their arms, and those who not resisted the Soviets were known as \"Cursed soldiers\", fighting in a number of different resistance groups, but their numbers were never large enough to seriously affect Soviet control, and most had been killed, captured, or simply gave up and slunk back to civilian like, by the early 1950s. \\n It is also worth noting that the Soviets were quite merciless to members of the AK. Thousands upon thousands were arrested in the aftermath of the war, simply for their previous membership. Many were accused of collaboration with the Nazis (because they had fought the Soviets... even though they were also fighting the Germans at the same time). The leadership who had not fled west, or at least into the woods, was mostly executed after showtrials, and thousands ended up in the gulag. \\n TL;DR \\n So to sum up the answer to your question, the Poles failed to effectively resist the Soviets because the Soviets, since the 1930s, had put in place a very effective campaign of persecution, pointedly designed to eliminate the most likely forces of resistance against their control of Poland. During the war, the Soviets did as little as possible to assist the Polish resistance, further ensuring it was weakened, and with the abandonment of the London government-in-exile by the Western Allies, any chance of outside support against Soviet hegemony over Poland was over. \\n ( Also, a minor point I realized I didn\\'t address. Poland did not became part of the USSR. It fell into their sphere of influence, and the USSR was certainly pulling a lot of the strings, but it was an independent state, not one of the constituent republics of the USSR ) \\n',\n  0),\n ('So, first off, we can\\'t look at Anabaptists over the 16th c. as one cohesive unit- or even argue that the movement stemmed from one genesis point. There were numerous different groups that sprung up in different geographic areas. This theory for the multiplicity of origins in the movement is termed \"polygenesis.\" \\n Because of the variety that existed in the movement, we get confusion, and hatred being attributed to all Anabaptists because of the practices of certain groups (ie what went down in Münster in 1534). So the Münster indecent occurred, when a group of Anabaptists, convinced that the end times had come chose to use violence to establish the new Jerusalem on earth. Led by Jan Matthys (from Haarlem in Holland) and Jan van Leyden, they baptized people by force, they adopted polygamy, and began killing anyone who resisted. They drove all non-Anabaptists from the city and started a bloody and brutal rule. \\n The leaders of the movement declared that Christ\\'s Kingdom had come, and many Anabaptists from other areas came to the city in hope- but, the Catholics in the area would have none of this violent-polygamous nonsense. They besieged Munster. Evenetually, the Catholic forces crushed the city and its resistance. Mattys and van Leyden were captured.  They were tortured and executed, and their bodies were hung in iron cages--- which were toured across the country- to show all other Anabaptists who may have had the idea to start their own New Jerusalem what failing would entail. It was also to spread the message of how dangerous these Anabaptists \"really\" were. \\n These iron cages were then hung St. Lambert\\'s church in Münster (you can see recreations of them still there today). \\n So this event scared the crap out of local rulers- not only could Anabaptists be religiously deviant- but they could also be politically deviant. These ones at Munster went so far as to try and begin their own city-state. This resulted in a lot of violent backlash against Anabaptists (who had already been getting it for being religiously deviant). \\n Other Anabaptist leaders immediately condemned the actions of the Munster Anabaptists- it was around this time that leaders like Menno Simons (from whom Mennonites get their name) started stressing that the Münsterites did not follow true Anabaptist ideals- like love, peace, separation of church and state, etc. The movement began to solidify in the mid 16th c., and Munster was cited as a deviant group- a mistake, not in line with real Anabaptist ideals. \\n But- even the more peaceable Anabaptists suffered because of assocation with Münster. \\n For non-Münster Anabaptists, the stress on separation of church and state is what got them into trouble as well. They were believed to be seditious, and it was thought they could not be loyal/proper citizens because of it. \\n I hope that helped!\\nTLDR; People hated them because of the Münster incident in 1534 gave Anabaptists a bad name all over, and belief in separation of church/state made rulers believe them to be seditious. Also propaganda helped with the hate/fear mongering. \\n Please don\\'t forget, simple religious unorthodoxy had been enough to get people tortured/killed/hunted for a long time in Europe before the Anabaptists. In the grand scheme of things... sadly not all that surprising. \\n Sources:\\nC. Arnold Snyder. Anabaptist History and Theology.

For short: there are no plans for constructions for castles. There are no two castles that are alike. It\\'s all about the  location! \\n First of all, the English term \"castle\" is a bit problematic. It\\'s not precise enough. There are three different kind of architecture, that for example in German have different names, that all can be called castle in English. [Burg]( [Schloss]( [Festung](\\nThese three types also have other names in English. I mean castles, palaces and fortresses. So when we are talking about castles here, I have [such a thing in mind]( [These]( are not castles I\\'m talking about. They are \"palaces\" or chateaus. They don\\'t have a defensive character to them anymore, and they are mostly build in or after the 16. century.\\nThe castles I\\'m going to talk about where build from the 8./9. century, untill 1525. Thats is the traditional ending of \"castles\" in Germany. \\n So, now unto the construction. \\n When I said, there where no Plans, I don\\'t mean, that they just started building without any idea how it will end up. I meant, there were no \"blueprints\". Every Construction was a completely new castles and every castles must be build differently. As I also said: Location! \\n Let\\'s assume you are a Lord, and have a certain amount of Land that belongs to you. This greatly reduces the places where you could build you castle. You perhaps have only 1 or 2 mountains, that are suitable. You perhaps don\\'t have ANY mountains where you wanted to build it on. Why mountains in the first place? Protection! The whole meaning of castles and protection is another huge topic, that would make a great post. But let\\'s just assume, you want to build a castle for personal protection. (Which was  not  always the main reason one would build a castle).\\nS building it on a mountain top is always the best solution. This is when the architect of that castle has to show what he can do. Depending on the make up of the mountain, and most importanly on the space thats available, the castle is getting its shape. \\n Now its getting complicated: \\n The main thing on a castle is its central, defensive, mostly tall building. This building, look extremely different in Germany, France or England. Due to reasons not interly clear, these three regions developed three differen types of \"Castle Buildings\". \\n \\n In Germany you have a single standing, tall, fortified Tower. -> a [Bergfried]( These were  not  used as living space. Because \"german\" castles had these Bergfriede in their castles, they also must had an extra building for the castle owner to live in. They were called [Palas]( \\n \\n In England they had [Keeps]( These were big fortified structures, that were also inhabitated. In some way, these were the german Bergfried and Palas combined. \\n \\n The French had a very similar thing as the english Keeps. the Donjons. These two things can even be used synonymous. There is only one tiny difference between French and English castles. In England, these Keeps were sometimes the only \"thing\" in a castle. The whole Keep  was  the [Castle]( In France, they were more often only [part of it]( \\n \\n \\n This is by no means a strict rule!  I showed very obvious examples. There are a lot(!) of castles in england that had keeps  in  them with several other building around them. And there a also tons of Towers in Germany, that one could call a Keep or a Donjon. This is just a very broad distinction, on what are typical forms of keeps in differen regions. \\n When we go back to the the actual construction, one has take that in mind, what we just talked about. If i wanted to build a typical German \" Burg \", I would firstly find a place, where i could build my  Bergfried . Then i would build the  Palas , and a surrounding Wall around all that. After all that, it would be up to the space I\\'ve left, what other buildings in which size I would/could add. \\n Castles typically had all the same kind of building in them. They just all looked differntly in different castles.\\nWe also haven\\'t talked about industrial, agricultural or producing buildings at all. A Castle had to be self-sustaining in the best case. For these things, They often had a special area, attached to the \"real\" castle, that was also fortified \\n TL:DR-Part for everything above: How you build a castle, depens 90% on the location you\\'re going to build it on. Depending on that, one had to make the decisions. Because of this, there are no blueprints on \"how to build a castle\". It always had to be done from scratch. The other 10% were what the people in these regions thought a castle was. German ones looked generelly different than English ones. And of course the  technology  that was available at that time and place. \\n The whole technology part is a huge part that is totally missing so far. This is really complicated to summarize. There where so many different types of castles like [Motte-and-baileys]( [Refugee Castles]( [Water castles]( etc. \\n As I said above, the most secure place to build was on top of a mountain or hill. But sometimes, you simply hadn\\'t any such things available where you would want to build. In these cases, you would, for example, build a Water Castle, or a Motte.  But  Motte and baileys were also build in regions where one had mountains and hills. This is because, the Motte and bailey castles are generally  older  than others. It\\'s not true, that they didn\\'t build them also later, but in a generall sense. \\n I think I\\'m going to stop here. I have no Idea what I\\'m trying to say anyway. This whole thing grew into a generell introduction on castles. Or a try there of ;) \\n',\n  0),\n (\"Population growth! \\n As best I can figure it, the state of Prussia (in which I assume you live, assuming it covers the entirety of modern Eastern Germany) grew at a frightening pace, nearly doubling its numbers in the years between 1871 and 1910. Part of this is probably due to the additional resources, increased economic (read: trading and currency exchange), and military power that the Reich enjoyed. On the other hand, much of this growth can be attributed to the Industrial Revolution, which allowed for the doubling of Europe's population during the 19th Century. Germany may have been slow at getting on that bandwagon (probably because industrialization would eventually be centered around the Ruhr, lands which were unconnected to dominant Prussia until 2/3rds of the way through the century). And while I could also launch into an argument about how the military-industrial impetus which would come to characterize Germany would also serve to industrialize the country (read: was indirectly responsible for the selfsame population growth about which we are speaking), that can wait for another time. \\n Now, the German government had a very vested interest in keeping its population somewhat happy - or at least not mutinous - during the years following the Empire's formation. A fantastic case-in-point is Bismarck's Social Security and Universal Healthcare policies: the man had little interest in the welfare of the people, he just needed them to trust the new state enough to make Communism seems less attractive. In the same vein, these tenement blocks were erected as a result of a huge housing crisis the government faced, especially in Berlin, where a real-estate shortage between the years of 1871-1889 came to a head and spurred on this huge urban development (think of it like a German-style Haussmannian renovation). It's not a coincidence that large stretches of what has today become the Berlin Metro system were built during this period as well. \\n tl;dr: Population growth put untenable pressure on the Government, so they commissioned huge housing and transport projects in major cities across the Empire, but most noticeably in Berlin \\n\",\n  0),\n ('U.S. Redditor here.  I find your question fascinating - but not your historical depiction of the British being \"dummies\" (or rather your recollection of that is how U.S. History was taught).  I upvoted you for your honesty and for this awesome discussion you started! \\n And I may be 100% wrong here - but this is my take on it. \\n Obviously without specific reference to the textbooks and lectures that your instructors provided, you may very well be right (God I hope not LOL) - however I believe that you might have misinterpreted that information. \\n My experience from U.S. History was:\\nAt the time, the British were arguably the strongest, best trained and best equipped force in the world.  The Continental Army was formed after the Battle of Lexington in 1775 and was comprised mainly of civilians and mercenaries who brought their own weapons (initially) and the army as a whole was never funded or equipped very well. \\n The British were highly a trained, disciplined force, accustomed more \"traditional\" warfare. \\n Initially the hit and run tactics of the Americans was a combination lack of discipline and strategic tactic. \\n From what I understood - Not that the British were \"dummies\", but rather, they were trained and had orders to fight in columns (which was a relic of war left over from the days of Rome).  Due to a combination of a very dynamic and rapidly changing battle (there was no \"front\"*), a high level of discipline (they didn\\'t break ranks), the fog of war (the generals couldn\\'t keep up with the quickly changing battle) - the British were very vulnerable to these type of guerilla tactics. \\n (note for clarity: \"there was no front\" - I meant that in many battles there was no organized and assembled army advancing in a column towards the British.) \\n TL:DR - The British weren\\'t dummies - they were just too damn disciplined to react effectively and quickly enough to the guerrilla tactics employed by the Americans.  Their training and discipline was, in part, their undoing. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"I don't have my sources handy as I'm at work, but I can provide a quick answer until someone with more citations comes along. \\n In the early stages of Zionism, under Ottoman rule, most Jewish land purchases were from absentee Ottoman landlords and the Jews bought land that wasn't cultivated by the fellahin (Arab agricultural workers), so there wasn't much interaction or hostility. The Jews were draining swamps, irrigating desert land, and generally working over land that was considered undesirable. Early on, some Zionist leaders, like Ben-Gurion, pushed to keep relations as civil as possible and minimize the friction between Jewish settlers and native Arabs. \\n As Zionist immigration increased in the 30s and the availability of uncultivated, absentee-owned land decreased, clashes between Zionists and the fellahin became more common.

A group of people following a leader, and that leader often claims a Devine connection. Eventually the following grows large enough and his spiritual teachings become important enough to document thus leading to many bibles and or religious text. Religions will often times be focused on attracting followers and tend to try and convert people, through both military or cultural force. As religions become more popular they tend to adjust their rules for incoming followers so that they can maintain and continue to have a big following. Modern day its become a bit different as in order to be qualified as a religion you really just have to set up a church and be able to have a \"divine\" book that would then allow you to have a tax break. A great example of two religions that are recent are mormonism and scientology. Both of these started of very similar to cults and are now growing. Mormonism is an example of making concessions (racial) in order to attract more followers, and eventually they will make some of their weirder things less popular in order to get more followers. Scientology is different in that its much newer, cults when they are founded tend to ask for a lot of money from their few followers, this gradually changes to asking for little money from tons of followers (catholic church) and scientology is now starting to lower their fees in order to attract more people. I cant find it now but i once saw a picture of a few traits all religions shared, one of them is a utopian society, another thing they all have in common is they have a force they fight against so they are generally structured the same.

In fact his birth name was AMENhotep IV, so he changed it so as to not pay homage to Amun, or the king of the Gods). His new religion, now called Atenism (or Atonism, depending on how you like to translate it), exalts the Sun Disc as the primary AND ONLY deity. Gone are Horus and Osiris, especially gone is the then super powerful (at least in the New Kingdom) Amun (later to become Amun-Ra, also known as the theologian's bullshit way of making their patron deity even more powerful/influence, and subsequently themselves). \\n I believe (through combing sources such as Akhenaten: The Heretic King, and some documents that survive of tombs from Amarna, as well as Hymns to Aten), that his religion was mainly a ploy to concentrate power in his hands, at the detrement of the established and highly powerful priesthood of Amun. He only reigned 17 years, with his religion dying with him. \\n EDIT: Yup, its 5 in the morning and I'm literally writing an essay on the guy for a class ATM. \\n TL;DR Monotheism introduced in ancient Egypt, did it to concentrate power, ended up getting the whole 'we hate you so much lets eradicate your memory from history' treatment right after he died. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('Repression along with better working conditions and generally higher stability.

I\\'m gonna jump into this one real quick :D Time to learn how the Romans did things! \\n Now, first and foremost, you MUST remember that \"Roman Training Camps\" were VERY different at different points of time. What I\\'m going to talk about is the post-Marian camps around the times of Julius and Octavian Caesar. \\n First off, the recruitment for the Legions began with something called a  dilectus.  What a  dilectus  involved was a Roman officer (Generally not the Primus Pilus, but definitely some of his subordinates), traveling from village to village in the area to find young men who wished to be in the Legions. There were a TON of good things for those who chose to Legion it up! Let\\'s go over some of the major rewards, because everyone loves a good shiny object. \\n \\n First off - we have the pay. Pay for Legionnaires was rather good, even if the life expectancy was shit. \\n \\n Secondly - the \"Wine and Women.\" Old veterans would reminisce of the pleasures of life as a Legionary (most of them would gloss over the back-breaking work.), foremost among these being the rewards of sacking a town. When Romans sacked a town, the town was essentially divided into sections (to prevent Roman soldiers killing each other in the orgy of looting that occurred), and each  cohort  got all of the loot in their section (Well, most of it went to the officers/general, but you get my meaning.) One principle piece of loot was (sorry, this is gonna step on some toes, but it\\'s the truth.) the women. Women in ancient cities...well, their lives sorta sucked if the city got conquered. They could expect to be repeatedly gang raped until the soldiers had sated themselves. If you were attractive, so much the worse. \\n \\n Thirdly - Glory. Honour and glory were the MOST valuable things to Romans (more important the more money you had to waste on it.) Romans were bred for ambition - and one of the best things on your resume was to have served in the Legions. \\n \\n Finally - A FANTASTIC retirement deal. They gave you 40 acres of good farmland if you survived your term. (Term length depended on who was in charge - Julius Caesar\\'s was 16 years, I believe, while Octavian/Augustus\\' was 20 years.) \\n \\n \\n So obviously, joining the legions was a very tempting prospect for a strapping young man! So when the  dilectus  came around, they would often find all the recruits they needed. Application was actually relatively easy - You had to be 18 (I\\'m using this number very abstractly - the only sources I can find just cite \"past the age of puberty, so it\\'s PROBABLY around 16, maybe even earlier - but 18 is a very safe number.), and you had to be fit and strong. How could they know who was 18, you ask? Well, you got someone to vouch for you. Generally, it was a parent, but if you paid an \"uncle\" enough, your \"uncle\" could vouch for you too. Needless to say, more often than not, these \"uncles\" had no relation to you, except that of a passionate love for the contents of your wallet. \\n Alrighty! You made it in! Now you\\'re going to be a soldier in shining  lorica segmentata,  fighting off barbarian hordes, earning honours and.....wait a sec. Nope. You\\'re just a common  tirones,  or  tiro  for short. This is the absolute lowest rank possible in the Roman Army.  Tiros  were not even allowed true shields or swords - they trained with heavier wooden facsimiles.

Tirones  could expect to spend up to six months in training before they were immediately promoted to the rank of  Gregarius  and sent out into the field.

The  Tirones  were drilled for ONE purpose only - very different from today\\'s military. They were drilled with discipline. They learned how to swing their swords and shields (the shield was a ridiculously good weapon too), but their primary lesson was discipline, keeping a level head, and staying in the proper rank and file. They learned to march, build camps, stand in formation, and they exercised quite a bit (something that you DO find in modern boot camp), with everything from rock laden packs to running and making camps, to \"The Post\" - or learning how to use your weapons. \\n TL;DR - Ish.

The first of these songs was probably \"Good Rocking Tonight.\"  The song, first recorded by Roy Brown in 1947, did not become popular until an artist by the name of Wynonie Harris did a cover with a gospel beat.... \\n --Radio:  A Complete Guide to the Industry by William A.

As time has gone by, TV has become more successful in this goal, thanks to the diminishing film market. \\n TV was, and still is, for the most part, a source of comfort, while Films are meant to inspire us at best, and \"take us for a ride\" at the very least. Anytime you hear about some controversy surrounding a show (classic example: Maude\\'s abortion episodes; modern example: the gay kids on Glee), it\\'s a TV show attempting to address a problem. And if no one likes your \"hippie\" cousin who tries to get your grandpa to stop saying racist things, why would anyone like a TV show that they watch in their pajamas telling them to be more open minded? \\n Because of the outrage, Networks discouraged shows from being controversial, but as time went by, they would let them go to bat during sweeps weeks, bringing in large numbers of people who want to see \"what the big deal is all about\". \\n Then came FOX (the network station, not the News). They trotted out Married...With Children, and then, a few years later, The Simpsons. The same outrage towards these shows, maybe even a bit more angry since they weren\\'t special episodes but full-blown series based on and regularly addressing \"wicked\" topics, like sex, drugs, mischievous behavior with little punishment, and other un-Christan things. This time, though, the ratings were through the roof regularly for the new little network, who quickly realized that, much like detractors of controversial books, plays, and even films, the loud do not speak for the many. \\n As the number of channels increased, so did the different options and number of ways for the different audiences to be reached. when networks weren\\'t getting good numbers on documentary specials, TLC and History Channel came along and made a source for those viewers. More niches were found, for whom more channels were made, and eventually you had 5 different channels airing Golden Girls reruns. \\n These new channels were a symbol of overbloated American culture. Then came HBO who, at first, was the stepping stone for films between theaters and standard-cable (standard-cable being the stepping stone from pay-cable to network TV). That was the first step towards the \"cinematizing\" of TV (I can make up words, too). Eventually, HBO was making profits, and decided to gamble on original programming to create more revenue. Their draw, though, was that there were no limits to what they could show (at first a freedom, but now many HBO/Showtime shows are asked by the networks to be racier at times). After a few shows like Arli$$ and The Larry Sanders Show, came The Sopranos. \\n Many people, to this day, hold it as the best series ever. It was produced as well as any film, and most importantly, it brought in monster ratings for HBO. This showed networks that the TV audience is no longer afraid of the heavy stuff. After a few more successes on the Pay-Cable networks, like The Wire, eventually standard-cable caught on (The Shield) and network stations are trying (Southland) but since they need larger numbers, are not succeeding very well. \\n This means there is a demand for creatives in Television. Since the film industry no longer fulfills the need many have of strong, heavy storytelling (I\\'m assuming that you have a passing knowledge of the Film Industry so you know how bad it is there) that leaves a lot of talent. With few places to go to tell great stories, many creatives are looking to Television to tell grand stories over the span of years, instead of slices-of-life that Independent films allow. Thus, many skilled writers, actors, directors, cinematographers, etc. are creating or working on shows like Mad Men, Sons of Anarchy, or the like. \\n And the lack of Talent in films comes the lack of fulfillment, so many people who actually enjoyed the heaviness of good cinema are now turning to TV, where people can now find high drama and insane production values in Mad Men, biting comedy and satire on South Park, uplifting and funny stories on Parks and Recreation, and even gore and horror on The Walking Dead (which also takes the bad parts of horror films: often bad characterizations). \\n I would also like to point out that the creators of many the \"best\" shows on TV (Parks and Recreation, Mad Men, Breaking Bad, Sons of Anarchy, etc) are all career TV-Writers. Famous names are coming to TV now because of those guys. \\n TL;DR: Films are creatively dying, so talent and audiences wanting quality jump ship to TV. \\n penguinofevil has it partially right in the competitiveness, but its at a point now where Television is in direct competition with Films in attracting people\\'s attention (and more successfully keeping it).

Why was it written? By whom? Was he/she in a position to know the things they did, or did they guess? Are there corroborating evidence (archaeological, perhaps)? Are there other sources which say the same thing? Who was the audience? Did they try as dispassionately as possible, or were they writing polemics? \\n A good example of this is the Byzantine writer/historian Procopius. Procopius is far and away the most important source of information about the most important time in the history of the Byzantine empire, the reign of Emperor Justinian (this was in the 6th century CE). One of his most famous books is called  Secret History , supposedly detailing all the secret goings-on behind the scenes in the court of Justinian, and it contains all sorts of fun anecdotes. \\n However, when Procopius wrote it, he had become deeply disillusioned with Justinian, he  hated  him, and that colors the entire book. How much of it can you actually trust, and how much of it is fabricated to make Justinian (and his wife, Theodora) look bad? \\n Take this passage, for example, where he describes the physical appearance of Justinian: \\n >I think this is as good a time as any to describe the personal appearance of the man. Now in physique he was neither tall nor short, but of average height; not thin, but moderately plump; his face was round, and not bad looking, for he had good color, even when he fasted for two days. \\n There aren't many pictures of Justinian from people who would have known how he looked like, so this scant description is one of the best sources we have for his appearance. Is it accurate? It probably is, why would he make such a dry and uninteresting description up, especially since some of his readers might very well know how he looked. And there's nothing outlandish about it, it sounds like an accurate description of how a man might look. In addition to that,  one of the pictures we do have . \\n But then, just after that passage, you get this: \\n >Now such was Justinian in appearance; but his character was something I could not fully describe. For he was at once villainous and amenable; as people say colloquially, a moron. He was never truthful with anyone, but always guileful in what he said and did, yet easily hoodwinked by any who wanted to deceive him. His nature was an unnatural mixture of folly and wickedness. \\n and \\n >This Emperor, then, was deceitful, devious, false, hypocritical, two-faced, cruel, skilled in dissembling his thought, never moved to tears by either joy or pain, though he could summon them artfully at will when the occasion demanded, a liar always, not only offhand, but in writing, and when he swore sacred oaths to his subjects in their very hearing. Then he would immediately break his agreements and pledges, like the vilest of slaves, whom indeed only the fear of torture drives to confess their perjury. A faithless friend, he was a treacherous enemy, insane for murder and plunder, quarrelsome and revolutionary, easily led to anything, but never willing to listen to good counsel, quick to plan mischief and carry it out, but finding even the hearing of anything good distasteful to his ears. \\n Clearly, this not a dispassionate and objective account of a man's character, this is a screed by man consumed with anger, who thinks Justinian is the devil incarnate (he does refer to him as literally demon-like later). And that's nothing compared with what he says about Theodora! \\n This colors the entire book and makes it exceedingly difficult to trust anything Procopius had to say about him. Is the description of his physical appearance (the thing I quoted first) accurate? I'd say that it probably is. But anything written in that book has to be considered suspect. \\n TL;DR: you have to use your judgment, multiple sources and corroborating evidence. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('The question of whether the Constitution is proslavery or antislavery, or somewhere in between, is extremely complex. People throughout the antebellum (pre-civil war) era debated this hotly, with abolitionists claiming the Constitution was inherently antislavery and many slaveholders claiming the opposite. I\\'m less of a constitutional scholar than I\\'d like (or plan) to be, but I can drop a few bits of knowledge on you that will help clarify. The short answer I\\'d give your liberal-extremist friends is simply that they\\'re full of shit. Slavery has been resoundingly abolished for almost 150 years and yet the Constitution still exists and the government hasn\\'t collapsed or been ineffectual in all other regards. Obviously the two can be separated, and their argument is a non-sequitur. But that\\'s an aside. \\n First remember that dozens of men signed the Declaration of Independence and/or had a hand in the design of the Constitution. Some owned slaves, some did not, and naturally opinions varied. What\\'s certain, though, is that by this time slavery had taken significant root in the Southern and Mid-Atlantic (up to mainly Virginia but also Maryland/Delaware). Slavery might have been technically legal in some Northern colonies at that time, notably New York, but at best it was on the way out. \\n As I mentioned in the other post, however, attitudes in defense of slavery varied over time, and during this time the \"necessary evil\" approach prevailed, which acknowledged slavery\\'s evils but claimed it was too valuable or necessary to abolish immediately. Thomas Jefferson is usually the leading example of this mentality. He owned upward of 200 slaves, is known to have fathered several children with them, etc. I haven\\'t myself heard of any specific examples of violence toward them but it\\'d be foolish to think it never happened, even if he wasn\\'t crueler than the average bear. Nevertheless, he lamented the presence of slavery in the country several times while refusing to give up his own slaves. It\\'s a bit of a contradiction, most definitely, but it shows a way of thinking at the time. While some were more steadfast in their defense of slavery, a good way of thinking about public opinion on the issue was that they would decry the \"necessary evil\" while always coming up with some excuse why it couldn\\'t be abolished, whether the economy or the scary spectre of a race war. \\n Now, as for the Constitution. Obviously if it was clear in its protection or neglect of slavery, the nature of the document wouldn\\'t be so hotly debated. This is because the Founders had varying interests, varying opinions, and forced through a series of compromises designed to placate both groups. The big ones I can remember offhand: \\n \\n It guaranteed the continuation of the international slave trade, but only for 20 years following ratification. When that guarantee expired in 1808, the slave trade was abolished and was never revived. \\n \\n The famous three/fifths compromise in which slaves counted as 3/5 of a person for voting purposes (of course, the owner got those votes, not the slaves). This addressed the issue of the South\\'s small population compared with the North, and was meant to balance out representation in Congress. This ultimately worked to the South\\'s advantage for many years, as they were given many additional seats (but not a majority) in the House of Representatives and, more importantly, additional electoral votes. Combined with their ability to deadlock the Senate, the South wielded considerable power in the federal government for years. \\n \\n A provision in the Constitution requiring fugitives bound in service or labor to be returned to their owners. In other words, the North had to help the South catch runaway slaves in stead of harboring them, giving them state residency/citizenship/whatever. This eventually led to several fugitive slave acts which were large points of contention between North and South. \\n \\n \\n Notice that nowhere in the Constitution does the word \"slave\" appear. And aside from these provisions it\\'s pretty damn ambiguous on the issue. While no one except a few abolitionists ever seriously claimed that it was constitutional to abolish slavery outright (seen as a state decision, even Lincoln claimed in 1860 that he had no right to interfere with slavery where it existed. Wartime presidential powers were later claimed to justify the Emancipation Proclamation), what about Washington D.C., a federal jurisdiction? What about western territories which hadn\\'t yet applied for statehood? Did the fugitive slave section require the action of state officials, or just federal ones, not to mention the constitutionality of Northern personal liberty laws? The list goes on and on, and in these debates each side would claim the backing of the Constitution. The document had some provisions which addressed slavery, even helped it flourish for decades, but if the document was cut and dry on the issue, then it would have been settled in the courts and the Civil War likely would not have happened. \\n Sorry for making such a long post... \\n TL;DR Some Founding Fathers owned slaves and defended the institution, but they were far from the fiery proslavery nutjobs that later claimed it was the best thing since sliced bread (did they have sliced bread then? I don\\'t even know). The Constitution contained compromises regarding slavery but isn\\'t explicitly pro-or anti-slavery. This is probably why people managed to fight about it so much, with both sides claiming the backing of the Constitution. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"The following is mostly on topic.

Besides, I am not risking leaving a friend behind while he is in trouble. \\n Another interesting tid bit, during the American civil war it is estimated that 70-90% of bullets fired by union troops went over the heads of their confederate counterparts.  This is due to many reasons, poor marksmanship, fear of reprisal killing, religious reasons, etc.  The idea of missing on purpose (save a warning shot) does not occur.  If someone has earned being shot at by me and mine it means that either myself or my friend(s) are in mortal danger.  I am going to do everything in my power to ensure their and my safety.  Furthermore, bullets travel an extreme distance.  I am not going to live the rest of my life wondering if those bullets I fired may have hit a bystander miles away.

In their eyes they had a moral duty to combat and support the national liberation of various countries that were under American control (Americans had billions  investmented all over the world, especially in their territories like Cuba).

More of a \"future\" question than a \"past\" question, but if I understand correctly, what you\\'re asking is whether 19th and 20th century cursive will eventually become part of the palaeographic field. For that, it might be useful to examine how and why palaeographic specializations have developed. \\n Most palaeographers wind up specializing in specific periods or styles. Learning all of them is prohibitively time-consuming if you want to make a reasonable contribution to scholarship in your lifetime. For example, even a gifted paleographer whose primary field is [the secretarial hands of the 16th century]( will be unable to read [8th century Insular documents]( without further training; they\\'re just too different. A good palaeographer is likely to pick it up  faster  than a layman would, or have limited experience from survey courses, but it\\'s not likely to be something he/she can read off the bat, and it\\'s extremely inefficient to keep bouncing around rather than settling on one period. \\n A lot of what drives this is the array of [scribal shortcuts/abbreviations]( and specialty letters that vary from period to period and location to location. The average manuscript wasn\\'t, of course, a prestige piece like the [Lindisfarne Gospels]( they\\'re letters, books copied without special attention to artistry, announcements, court documents, town records, etc. Most scribes wrote these as quickly as they could while still remaining legible --  anything  that would reduce the amount of wear and tear on their hands over the course of the day -- and it\\'s really the amazing number of shortcuts they used that make these documents so impossible to read at first glance. \\n So. This is where we break from history (I apologize, mods; let me know if I should delete this) and wonder about what will happen in the future. As a  guess,  and it is nothing more than that, 19th and 20th century cursive isn\\'t likely to present quite as many legibility difficulties even to untrained readers; they overlap with the development of the typewriter and subsequently the computer, and they\\'re largely devoid of the sigla that are endemic to the time before printing. Modern typed English letters are very close to how they\\'re hand-written, mostly even identical. Cursive letters range from nearly identical to ... hmm, like the [F, Q, and Z of the Palmer Method]( Not identical, but not tough to figure out, either. \\n TL:DR:  19th and 20th century English cursive probably won\\'t be able to justify its own specialty in palaeography, simply because: \\n \\n Widespread access to typing developed alongside 19th and 20th century English cursive and made use of the standard English letters of the day.

But we\\'re not talking about the planned economy that Albert Einstein proposed and wrote about, we\\'re talking about a planned economy in which the state had total bureaucratic control. Through this a \"full employment policy\" was adopted. This meant that the state made sure everyone had a job, and that lead to an gigantic public sector. \\n A gigantic public sector isn\\'t necessarily a bad thing, but for the Soviet Union it was doom. Because of the full employment policy, the incentive to have skill and discipline in the workforce vanished. Soviet workers basically didn\\'t work well because they had a guaranteed need to be hired. Basically, no one was really producing value because the incentive to be valuable vanished. \\n The oil prices were also a huge factor, but that has been discussed here. Basically, prices fell, the Soviets didn\\'t see it coming, and they overspent their money. The large budget deficits became a problem when they could no longer borrow due to such high interest rates. \\n While I can\\'t really give you a great analysis of the social problems, (though you can pretty much see that there was much social unrest from the oppressed populace) I can give a basic economic summary: \\n Full employment policies created a workplace that was not based on supply and demand, making the requirement for skill to sharply decline. This lead to not much value coming from the country and large amounts of monetary waste. Coupling this with massive military spending, inflation and long term debt became a huge problem. Interest rates rose sky high because of the mass amounts of borrowing and spending, and this pummeled the liquidity of money. \\n TL;DR: Full employment policy lead a lack of incentive to create value, mass spending shot interest rates too high, and long term debt made stimulus and changes to the money supply too hard. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"Gorbachev himself was irrelevant to the collapse of the Soviet Union. \\n OP is essentially correct.

For example, this: \\n >They had thoughtful democracies, with fairly modern ideas of justice and ethics. \\n Is simply false.  Roman notions of justice and ethics are assuredly not \"fairly modern\".  In fact, most modern notions of ethics and justice are profoundly rooted in Christianity or in a reaction to Christianity.  Also, Rome was (pretty famously) ruled by an emperor for the last 500 years or so.  Finally, to suggest that the societies of antiquity were not \"superstitious\" (I don\\'t think that\\'s a particularly useful term in this context) or that Rome was not \"war-mongering\" is absurd. \\n Yes, after the collapse of basically all major political structures in the west during the fall of the Western Empire, there was a period of limited intellectual production, but this is the sort of thing that tends to happen when you\\'re starving to death and Magyars are stabbing everyone in town.  Once this situation had calmed down a bit, intellectual culture quickly rebuilt itself.  In fact, the Middle Ages saw an expansion of intellectual culture, with the spread of literacy, the invention of the cathedral school and university, the widespread \"book culture\" of Christianity, and eventually the development of the printing press far beyond any which existed in antiquity. \\n tl;dr the Dark Ages are a myth, invented by folks interested in valorizing their own time and justifying breaks with earlier traditions. \\n',\n  0),\n (\"For most of human history, people had just enough food to survive.

The founders were Anton Drexler (who was the de facto leader), Karl Harrer, Gottfried Feder, and Dietrich Eckhart. It began as a very small, almost club-like organization. Hitler attended one of their debates and agreed with many of their positions, chiefly on German nationalism, rejection of the Versailles Treaty, and anti-Semitism. \\n Hitler spoke in their favor at a debate and impressed the DAP leadership with his charisma, who swiftly made him a propaganda chief. In about 1920-21, Hitler persuaded Drexler to rename it the NSDAP, aka the Nazi Party, and slowly pushed the others out of the way and became the de facto leader himself. After the failed Beer Hall Putsch of 1923, the party was disbanded and only reformed in 1925 solely under Hitler. Drexler, Harrer, and Feder somewhat faded into obscurity (something I found really odd), while Eckhart died before the NSDAP gained momentum. \\n To TL;DR this, the others didn't have the vision or charisma that Hitler did. He was responsible for getting the party a large following and polishing it into a nationally known organization. It is doubtful that Nazism would have came into being had they not invited Hitler into their group, however. On the other end, Drexler's teachings have Hitler a convenient jump start. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('It had a huge effect. For the past 35-45 years the Republican Party could be reasonably viewed as a white people\\'s party because on a national level they are almost exclusively supported by white people and tend to support policies that would roll back civil rights laws that they see as excessive (affirmative action for instance). \\n The democrats on the other hand have a much more diverse base of support and almost always seek to preserve and expand civil rights legislation. \\n This was not always the case. \\n From around 1850-1950, the Republicans were the party of racial equality (or something approaching that). They were abolitionists before the civil war, supported rights for former slaves after the conflict and could generally count on the support of African Americans. \\n At this time Democrats for their part could generally count on poor, urban whites in the north east and rural white southerners as their main political bases. Southern democratic politicians usually branded themselves as white populists, had strong confederate sympathies well into the 20th century and often had very open ties to groups like the KKK. \\n As black people from the south moved into urban democratic strongholds and began to demand civil rights across the country, the National apparatus of the Democratic party decided it would be politically worthwhile to champion black rights, both to keep control of cities and to get the strong support of black voters across the country. \\n LBJ in particular personified this change when he signed civil rights act of 1964. He knew that support for this would cost the Democratic party the \"solid south\" but he thought it was worth it to gain minority and progressive support, and also arguably thought it was the right thing to do. \\n LBJ is quoted saying \"I know the risks are great and we might lose the South\" which of course they did, but support for civil rights won the democratic party the lasting support of black people and other minorities. The republicans of course took advantage of this, became the new champion of southern/conservative whites. \\n TL/DR \\n More broadly Democratic support for civil rights solidified a trend where the Democrats moved away from simple populism and machine politics to a Party defined by support for minority rights generally and trust in government intervention to cure social problems. \\n Republicans for their part moved from being a patrician, centrist party that was based on the support of well educated, coastal professionals to a party that is based on preservation of traditional social roles and distrust of government intervention which is firmly based among rural whites. \\n Both these changes had been brewing since at least the New Deal era, but the Civil Rights movement was a watershed. \\n',\n  0),\n ('If you have any specific questions ask and I\\'ll help you out there! \\n \\n Let\\'s start with the Austro-Prussian War. The Prussian\\'s enter the ring with the Dreyfus Needle Gun, a breech loaded bolt action rifle, which could fire 8-10 rounds per minute which could be loaded and fired from the prone position as well as having an effective range of over 650 meters. The Austrians in comparison were using a muzzle loaded rifled musket called the Lorenz. This could not be fired while in the prone position and while having an effective range of 500-550 meters which could contend with the Needle Rifle was dwarfed in firing rate. Again, 8-10 rounds per minute for the former but the latter would be lucky to get 4 out, maybe 3. Add into that the flexibility of the Needle Gun (firing from prone, much more reliable, etc.) and many Prussian thinkers thought that 300 of their men were superior to a battalion of Austrians. \\n They were completely right. This is how the Prussians fought in the Austro-Prussian War: They would send up a \"skirmishing line\" 2 lines deep. Remember in the ACW how men would be packed together elbow to elbow? Each man would be given a 3 meters between each of them -- 10 feet-ish a couple dozen men wide. Basically these 2 lines would approach the enemy and use cover as they saw fit and approached and retreated as they saw fit (again, infantry chains). The rest of the battalion would sit back and send in platoons/company\\'s to reinforce the skirmishing line throughout the battle. That is, essentially, what WWI fighting was in the infantry realm of things. Skirmishing lines of men approaching an enemy position with strong reserves constantly reinforcing them in \\'waves\\'. \\n The Austrians, in contrast, were heavily influenced by their very recent war with France in 1859. Basically because both sides used muzzle loaded muskets in that war the French decided if they could rapidly charge the Austrians during their significant reload times, even if they ate the casualties, the Austrian weapons would still be sighted for long ranges (which makes their guns shoot high) and the Austrians would just straight up miss once they got close. It worked amazingly well. The Austrians would dub this  Stoßtaktik , shock tactics, and it was the central idea of their military theory going into the Austro-Prussian War just 7 years later. The Austrians would, completely and utterly, be annihilated by the Prussian forces. They would charge in dense formations in their \"shock tactics\" and would try to use their cavalry to support these charges. Both of which would melt under Prussian infantry chains at significant range before they could inflict any casualties. As the Austrians were charging more or less shoulder to shoulder the Prussians were lying prone next to a tree or a rock or what have you and picking them off. At Podol 400 Prussians would face off against 2000 Austrians and they would, in the truest sense, obliterate them. The Prussians would have 100 killed or injured with the Austrians having over 1000 killed, injured, or captured. At Trautenau, one of Austria\\'s few \"victories\", they would lose 5000 men compared to Prussia\\'s 1300.  The biggest battle of the war, the Battle of Königgrätz, saw 9000 Prussians killed or wounded with  43,500 Austrians killed, captured, or wounded. \\n The Franco-Prussian War was an interesting war because it was one where the French had every advantage in regards to infantry but a distinct disadvantage with artillery and operational and strategic command. In response to the Needle Gun they standardized their own breech loaded rifle, the Chassepot. It shot faster, more accurately, and over further distances than the Needle Gun to a noticeable effect. We see throughout all the early battles the French absolutely slaughtering the Prussian forces even with distinctly less men present. Entire Prussian columns would be held up by a few dozen men at times while their cavalry charges would melt under rifle fire. These battles were truly the end of the age of shock cavalry. The reason the French lost so horrendously was not an issue of tactics but more of an operational one, as I do feel this bears mentioning. The Prussians were capable of mobilizing a massive force much quicker than the French and basically pounded them into encirclement at Metz and then Sedan. The French simply did not have the time to react in time. With that said though, the Prussians did have a distinct advantage in the artillery department. \\n >  In the woods and close country which lay before the French positions the temptation to \\'get lost\\' was sometimes overwhelming. Only close order could give the infantry confidence, and close order in the face of breech-loading rifles was suicidal. The answer to the problem, as the Germans discovered during the course of the campaign, was for the infantry, so long as its armament was inferior to that of the enemy, to hold back and leave matters to the guns; and the German field artillery proved quite capable of settling matter itself. Its range and rate of fire gave it, at the beginning of both battles, such an ascendancy that the French gunners -- including the dreaded mitrailleuses^[1] --were silenced in a matter of minutes. ^[2] \\n It was ultimately German artillery which won the day for the Germans and how most battles in the Franco-Prussian War were determined, at least the significant ones. The French would entrench themselves and attempt desperate cavalry charges as they were surrounded but could not contest the Prussian artillery. The French still used muzzle loaded artillery which had to be set to detonate at set distances and thus the rounds had to be precisely timed to strike certain areas of the enemy at a certain distance. It was quite complicated and cumbersome at best. The Prussians, however, had breech loaded artillery which, while at a lesser range than the French, had a significant rate of fire advantage and also had percussion impact fuses which meant wherever the shell hit that\\'s where it exploded. To make things even more deadly the Prussians made a habit of putting  all  of their artillery in one area and firing as a single empowered battery right at the front to obliterate the enemy. The French would be battered by combined German artillery while being squeezed from all sides by the infantry (despite the Germans suffering egregious casualties -- one Prussian company suffered 68% casualties at Mars-la-Toure for instance). Eventually, after being operationally and strategically outplayed the majority of the French army and Napoleon III would be forced into encirclement at Sedan and, with no hope of breaking out, would surrender and thus the  de facto  end for the French. \\n \\n TL;DR: \\n \\n 1866 Austro-Prussian War:  The Austrians replicated what the French used successfully against them in the Italian Wars in 1859. That is, they sent densely packed columns in rapid charge against loose Prussian rifle chains / skirmish lines using breech loaded rifles; as you imagine it went horribly. I would also observe this is one of the only cases in history that I have studied where a clear technological and tactical doctrine advantage is achieved between Western powers. \\n \\n 1870/71 Franco-Prussian War:  The French would be on par if not superior to the Prussians in many respects in the realm of infantry and cavalry. The Prussians however would operationally and strategically outplay the French by mobilizing so rapidly the French would not have time to react in any meaningful way. Even despite high Prussian casualty counts they would strike so rapidly the French would be beaten back in successive losses and eventually (and quickly) encircled. Because of the encirclement the Prussians used their superior (technologically and doctrinally used) artillery in \\'batteries\\' which basically pounded away at the surrounded Napoleon III (along with the rest of the army) and causing the eventual white flag. \\n \\n \\n \\n Notes: \\n ^[1]  Mitrailleuses  were proto-machine guns which could fire up to 200 rounds per minute. \\n ^[2] Howard, Michael,  The Franco-Prussian War: The German Invasion of France 1870-1871 , pp. 118 \\n',\n  0),\n ('Firstly I\\'d recommend my post on the question [When were pikes \"phased out\" on the European battlefield? What lead to this change?]( which discusses the rise of the musket. \\n As for your question specifically I will recommend /u/Rittermeister\\'s post [here]( on specifically this topic. \\n The basic reasons? \\n \\n The English Longbow was an outlier of effectiveness but we can use it in the \\'best case\\' scenario. With a 150 pound draw using a 905 grain arrowtip firing at about 250 ft/s that generates about 127 ft/lb\\'s of energy with a firing distance of ~200 meters. A .69 and .75 caliber smoothbore musket can, with a 220 grain load, for the cost of half the range, achieve a muzzle velocity of ~1100ft/s and a kinetic impact of ~900ft/lb\\'s. As in, a gun gets to the target effectively instantly and penetrates just about every single thing they\\'re wearing. If by some miracle they survive they\\'re knocked onto their butts and aren\\'t getting up. However the rest of Europe did not use the English longbow and the rest of Europe reports during the crusades, as /u/Rittermeister says above, that padded mail would stop a hail of arrows in their place. They simply did not have penetrating power. In other words when an arrow hit someone it  might  kill them; when a bullet hits someone it  will  kill them. \\n \\n Training. Bows required years of training to become mildly proficient at; even if we\\'re just talking about \\'volley fire\\' they required arm strength and training to use to a significant way. I mean the Longbow is the commonly cited example and it had a 150 pound draw weight up to 185 pound draw. It frankly required a certain level of physical aptitude to use a bow. A gun required none of that,  anyone  could use a gun. Further a gun required, at most, 1-2 weeks to train a man to use. It didn\\'t require years of training and physical aptitude it required pointing at the enemy and pressing a button. \\n \\n Morale. Being shot by a musket  is fucking terrifying . They blow out ear drums, they produce a crap ton of smoke, and they penetrate just about everything coming your way. Now that\\'s just one -- imagine 100, or 200. All coming at once with all the smoke and sound. Bows produced a similar effect from volley fire but nothing like the boom and the smoke of a musket and that can\\'t be ignored. Dave Grossman\\'s  On Killing  talks about this specifically and points to it being the crucible point to why, despite being \\'technically\\' less accurate and having less range than bows early muskets took over. \\n \\n Let me emphasize this again:  Firing a bow is a very physical activity. Even a sick, weak, and old person could use a gun where using a bow required top physical shape, years of training, and even then they will reduce in effectiveness as the bowman himself wears out. \\n \\n Ease of production. Muskets allowed anyone to use them and, believe it or not, were even easier to produce. Yes it required more mechanical parts but they were consistently made mechanical parts --- the parts were common amongst all of them and it was almost \\'standardized\\'. Bows required finesse to make and craftsmanship and perfect wood and flax and all that bullcrap. A musket could be made by any self respecting blacksmith in a relatively straight forward fashion and in larger amounts and a longbow required 4-6 required to make! If a musket was broken it was standardized parts so it can be fixed and reused relatively simply; if a bow was broken it was done for. \\n \\n They did not take that long to reload! Matchlock muskets could fire 2 shots per minute reliably and when we got to flintlock muskets in the early 1600\\'s that time was reduced to a 15-25 second reload time -- up to 4 shots per minute. They also were not \\'horribly inaccurate\\' and could be reliably fired up to a range of 75-100 yards. That is not bad at all. \\n \\n The simplest fact of them all:  Armies equipped with firearms consistently defeated those without them.  Do we need another reason than that? \\n \\n \\n So the tl;dr: They replaced a weapon with significant range but with lesser penetrating power, high training burdens, high manufacturing burdens with variable quality and less flexibility for a weapon with less range but significantly more penetrating power, no training burden, next to no manufacturing burden with consistent quality and shared parts with more flexibility and the added affect of being freaking terrifying. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Methinks2015 and Germanarchaeologist are right. \\n For the record, to Germanarchaeologist\\'s discussion of pre-Phoenician alphabetic scripts, add Ugaritic cuneiform, which was in use ca. 1500-1200 BCE (Ugarit was destroyed at the end of the Bronze Age) and is enormously better attested than any other pre-Phoenician alphabetic script. \\n However, to continue in the spirit of the \"what if\": without the Phoenicians it\\'s likely that the Greeks would have got their writing system from the Egyptians (probably indirectly, via Lydia I imagine) instead of the Phoenicians.

They also have one of the most developed health industries in the Americas (it is often rated much higher than the U.S.'s, and they spend much less of their GDP on health care than we do), and the average life expectancy of a tico (79.3 years) is the second highest in the Americas and higher than that of the United States (78.6 years). \\n There are also not many countries that would be interested in attacking Costa Rica. Although they don't have a military, they do have a Police Force and the United States has a offered to defend Costa Rican if someone were to attack them (but again, there is not much cause to). \\n As to your point about the civil wars in neighboring countries, many of those wars featured conflict between indigenous populations and peoples of European descent (mestizos). Thousands of Mayans were executed by the Guatemalan government during the revolution there, because they were suspected of aiding the rebels. Due to the geography of Costa Rica there was never a large native population in the country, and even after Spain colonized it there was never any massive migration of people to live there.  This lack of conflict between settlers and indigenous people reduced the need for a large military relatively early on in their history. \\n tl;dr There are not many people who would want to attack them. Additionally, following their own Civil War many people were suspicious of the military (and militaries in general, after seeing what was happening in neighboring countries). By abolishing the military and diverting the funds to internal development, they were able to increase the quality of life to such a high level that a military was no longer necessary to maintain peace internally. \\n I can find sources for you if you'd like, I don't have time to find them at the moment but I've read quite extensively on the subject through my coursework at university and would be more than happy to dig some up for you later. If you ever get the chance to visit Costa Rica you most certainly should, it is an absolutely amazing country and is in my top 3 that I have visited. \\n\",\n  0),\n ('I think, as it always is with speaking about sex, it depended on the social circle. Vern L. Burroughs\\' book  The Subordinated Sex: A History of Attitudes Towards Women  has a chapter titled \"The \\'Rise\\' of Women and the Fall of Rome.\" In that chapter, there\\'s a discussion of women as slaves having to do with their status as mistresses and the hope of matrimony. I\\'ll give you the paragraph here: \\n \"Even under Augustus the slave woman who attracted her master had little choice, if he was married, but to become his mistress, or one of his many mistresses. Most slaveholders had slave women, and some of the women even earned their freedom by serving their masters. Cato, the guardian of public morals mentioned earlier, was greatly surprised to  find that his son and daughter-in-law were irritated by the fact that he had kept a slave woman as a mistress while his wive was alive. This, after all, was a matter of custom, not of morals. [...] Concubines were found at all levels of the social ladder. For example, the emperors Vespasian, Marcus Aurelius, and Antonius Pius all took concubines after their wives has died. Marcus Aurelius  claimed  he did so because he did not wish his children to suffer from a stepmother, although in his meditations he had written that he was most happy he had managed to avoid overlong contact with his grandfather\\'s concubine.\" \\n In this passage, both Cato and Marcus Aurelius seem to not only have talked about their relations with slaves, but included it in their respected writings. CAto\\'s children even expressed their disapproval with Cato. \\n TL;DR: Gossip is gossip, no matter what the century. \\n',\n  0),\n ('Aztec education was heavily focused on two aspects:  the religious and the military.  The Mendocino Codex depicts how the Aztec youth were instructed from their birth. \\n When an infant was born, the midwife or  Tecitl  would give a speech that remarked on the social function and distinction between men and women.    Before the baby could walk there was a special ceremony in which the parents would \"consecrate\" the child to his/her future school.   A lot of the education was give at home and it was expected of the parents to teach children the social norms and important customs.  It was a harsh education and punishment was clearly delineated: \\n 3 yo would get verbal reprimands\\n4 yo physical punishment\\n8 yo threats of punishment by maguey barbs\\n9 yo punishment by maguey barbs\\n10 yo  boys would receive caning and girls would be tied and threatened with caning\\n11 yo punishment by chili smoke\\n12 yo boys slept in wet ground. girls were made to sweep the streets after dark \\n Girls were expected to learn to pick and spin cotton, sewing, grind chili, sweep and clean the house among other house chores. \\n Boys were taught to farm, trade, make fires, mend fishing nets and fishing.  Often they would also learn their father´s trade. \\n Among the social norms that were taught were: love and obedience to their parents, fear of the gods and duty, \\n Public education began at 15 yo.  Depending on the social class of the student they could either go to the  Calmecac or Tepuchcalli . \\n The  Calmecac  was reserved for the noble classes.  The school was located next to the temple and the noble class could study to become a priest.  There were 3 grades each 5 year long.  Besides the religious education they received martial/military education.  There were some science classes which included astronomy and calendar reading, public speaking, writing and math.   Some women were admitted to the  Calmecac  but they were only taught the religious aspects. \\n In the  Tepuchcalli  was for the rest of the population.  There was one in each part of the city.  They had to keep the school and work for it`s maintenance.  They also help building streets and temples for the city. The main focus of this school was war.  They learned survival skills, fighting with diverse weapons and spying.  Women were allowed to an all female  Tepuchcalli  they were taught domestic chores and religion. \\n TL;DR:  at 12 you´re still being educated by your family in the basic social and whatever trade your family has. \\n Sources:\\n1.- CLAVIJERO S.J.

Body counts and material losses, to put it bluntly, are important; but only to a certain extent. Efficacy and ability to fight on are the most important part of full spectrum combat; is the enemy a cohesive force, is his will to fight unbroken, is his  physical ability to fight  unbroken, can/will the enemy fight if pursued? \\n For the German 6th Army, all of these questions end in a resounding 'no.' The army as the Germans know it, ceased to exist; and it was a blow from which the Germans never truly recovered. Their ability to continue to wage combat at the same intensity  before  the battle never recovered. For the battered 62 Army, and the Don Front it was apart of, it was back in action within a matter of months.  It was yet another degrading of their combat ability from 1941 (A broad, 3 Army Group wide offensive); combat operations in 1943 would stretch the Wehrmacht to the limit to retain the same offensive power of the combat operations in 1942. \\n I would refer you to [this]( question where myself and /u/elos_ go into more depth as to  why  the 6th Army was defeated, and why it should be considered a decisive, not Pyrrhic, Soviet victory. \\n TL DR: For the Soviets to have 'won' a Pyrrhic victory, their ability to continue their tempo of operations would have had to have been drastically reducted. It was not, rather, it completely shifted the initiative in their favor and allowed them to  step up  their tempo of operations. The exact opposite of the definition of a Pyrrhic. \\n\",\n  0),\n (\"This is a bit of a rant, but 'rigid phalanxes lose against flexible Romans' is a trope I see repeated in a lot of places (including Wikipedia), and I feel a need to respond to it. \\n Phillip V's army was soundly defeated in the battle, but when you read the description of how it happened, it turns out that he wasn't exactly a military genius.  The Roman manipular system was adopted precisely for the purpose of fighting in hills (in Samnite wars), because phalanxes didn't do well in rough and broken terrain (and sarissa phalanxes were no different than hoplites in that respect).  Phillip attacked the Romans on a hill, and lost.  It's a bit more complicated than that, but my first point is that he certainly wasn't fighting at a place that favored him. \\n It should also be said, by this time in history there weren't trained nearly as good as in Alexander's time.  There was nothing inherently inferior about those tactics, the similar type of warfare will be used extensively in the Medieval period in Europe (pikes are after all, not that dissimilar to sarissas, they are about the same size actually), while the triple-line manipular system will go out of fashion in about 120 years. \\n The Romans also used elephants in the battle which was about the only thing that could crash through the front of a phalanx, and since it historically took a fair number of defeats and losses for the Romans to learn how to cope with elephants on the battlefield,  I'm not too keen to put this as a point against the Macedonians.   The Romans could at this point easily afford to ship war elephants to Greece, and a war elephant will eat and drink as much as 200 soldiers. \\n The other point is that at this period in history Rome has made several military blunders far, far worse than Phillip V's one botched battle - at Cannae alone they lost 10 times more troops.  Phillip had to fold and sue for peace after one lost battle, while Rome could suffer multiple crushing defeats and still keep fighting. \\n There's something to be said about Roman obstinacy, that they would just keep going when many others would have given up, but you can't do that without manpower and the whole of Greece was simply depleted after centuries of infighting. \\n tl;dr; War is not purely a function of military tactics and formations.

From a spiritual point of view, the biggest \"benefit of converting\" was not condemning your soul to eternal damnation. Religion wasn\\'t exclusively a tool to be manipulated by the elite (although to pretend that it wasn\\'t at all would be naive). Now, it is true that England was a decidedly top down Reformation (which is one of the many, many, reasons for why the next two hundred years of church history was so contentious), but there was grassroots movement. Just look at the Iconoclasm. That doesn\\'t happen just because the king tells you to and you want to riot. There\\'s plenty of evidence of this taking place, in all parts of the country. That said, historiography recently has moved towards the idea that Catholicism was a healthy, vibrant religion right up until the reformation, but it\\'s religion: you\\'d hardly expect everyone to agree. \\n (In relation to one of your other points, split allegiance had never really been an issue, unless people decided they wanted it to be, does that make sense? Monarchies would in general do their best to stay on the good side of the papacy, because it gave them an external support for their position. There were exceptions of course, but generally speaking, the Pope was a good friend to have, especially when you could convince him to do things like appointing your five infant bastards as priors and abbots of fairly major monastic foundations (as James V of Scotland did, among many others)) \\n In regards to Henry himself, aside from the divorce issue, he was a rather conservative Catholic, so it is possible to envisage that he would not have moved away from the church, but a number of very prominent people in England; most notably Cromwell, Cramner, Richard Rich from the gentry, and the Dudley and Boleyn families from the nobility had protestant sympathies before the divorce. Now you could claim that without the Divorce, many of them would never have risen to the prominence they did, and this is perhaps true, but when he could keep a hold on his temper, Henry rewarded and indeed relied on effective administrators and ministerial staff. \\nThere is also the problem of Mary. Assuming she inherits the throne, would she have been so rabidly anti-protestantism in this counter factual universe? Probably not, because it hadn\\'t been the source of so much personal humiliation and suffering. Certainly, she\\'d have Catholic still, but I think if you consider it in comparison to Scotland, reformation would probably have come under Mary. \\n Essentially, the situation in Scotland is a very devoutly Catholic Monarch, (Mary I), who is a bit useless but people for the most part are able to live with, and again healthy catholicism on the ground. Then, for a variety of reasons, in 1560 everything changes almost overnight. Parliament votes Calvinist Protestantism as the state religion, and a large proportion of the major nobility (including a number of Mary\\'s close relatives, and led by her half brother) suddenly declare themselves in favour of the new faith, and start a CIVIL WAR. Mary certainly had no desire for protestantism, and there was no financial benefit for Scotland to do so (apart from trade with England, but well, France, Spain and the Empire were richer, and they were still Catholic). It was just because people sincerely and legitimately believed that Calvinism was a better religion. \\n TL;DR Religion isn\\'t exclusively a political tool. There\\'s no inevitablity, but protestantism would have come in to a degree either way, just as it did in Scotland.

If there were 100 million Indians, that\\'s bigger than the number counted in the US census during World War I. It\\'s roughly the size of a high-end estimate of the Roman Empire including all the territorial holdings, which is probably roughly comparable in area as well. It\\'s like the difference between Mongolia and China. \\n If that\\'s the case, then everything we think we know about Pre-Columbian America is completely wrong, simply because so much of it would have to be, by necessity, so much more politically organized, and interconnected, as well as more technologically advanced, urbanized, and agrarian, than it is generally believed to have been. Either the Aztec and/or Inca Empires were far bigger and more dense than currently believed, or there were several additional civilizations of equivalent or near-equivalent size that Europeans never saw, or only encountered so indirectly or in such a collapsed state that we really know nothing about them - imagine if the only things we knew about Rome came from records of a few encounters with some Breton lord in the middle of the Dark Ages, or the ruins of a Byzantium trading post. \\n And there are also sorts of other, random implications - for example, there would have been essentially a long period in which vast swaths of the Americas went \"feral\", going from permanently settled to completely undeveloped, before being re-settled under European influence. Which happened anyway, of course, but if 100 million people disappeared, most of the arable land was probably under agriculture. The whole Midwestern landscape of vast grassy plains covered with Bison might have been a temporary event, the aftereffects of a series of crazy population explosions (and possibly invasive species), and not the natural state of things. \\n TL; DR: That got way off-topic, and all these things are true to a certain extent anyway, but objective facts are incredibly important because otherwise you have no way of knowing if the individual narratives are plausible, or representative, or what.

Some have claimed as high as 100 million, though this seems to be exaggerating.  Note that this is for both North and South America; population estimates for North America vary from 3 million to 15 million (or higher, in some cases). \\n The thing is, we don\\'t have reliable records to figure this out.  James Davidson and Mark Lytle have a great book on this called  After the Fact: The Art of Historical Detection  (2004).

It\\'s suspected that pigs brought along on De Soto\\'s expedition escaped into the wilderness carrying disease.

What would be a \"satisfying\" number? \\n At the end of the day, the important thing is this: when Europeans stumbled into the Americas, the epidemic diseases they brought with them greatly disrupted Native American communities.  Turning this into a numbers game seems to suggest that it\\'s all about proving that without diseases like smallpox, then Native Americans would have \"won,\" when a whole host of factors had to fall into place for Europeans to \"conquer\" the New World. \\n It also treats these historical groups as a false dichotomy: Europeans vs. Native Americas, when neither of those groups was a monolithic entity.  The main reason Cortés was able to defeat the Aztecs was because there were a lot of pissed-off Mesoamerican tribes who sided with the Conquistadors.  That false dichotomy seems to be based on a reading of modern notions of \"race\" back into the 15th and 16th centuries, when these binaries didn\\'t exist.

There are always other motivations. One of the most important sources of knights for the Crusades was younger brothers/sons. They weren't necessarily going for the sake of Christendom, but rather because they didn't stand to inherit anything upon the death of their father.

The military establishment, an elite and well respected circle during the time of the German empire, did everything it could to encourage this belief that Germany\\'s military had not been crushed during the war, and even went so far as to claim that Germany  had not been defeated militarily at all . The country was breaking down internally during the last months of the war, with the famous German Revolution of 1918 erupting in October of that year and culminating with the end of the German Empire. By November 9th, 1918 (just two days before armistice) a German Republic was proclaimed, and the kaiser abdicated the throne soon after. The German military, including future Weimar president Hindenburg, began circulating the idea that Germany had not been truly defeated by the Allies but had been virtually stabbed in the back by the radicals and revolutionaries. The military made sure to not be included in the delegation for the armistice agreement, and sure enough the armistice was signed by Matthias Erzberger, a German politician who had always been opposed to the war. \\n Now we have a situation where Germany lost pretty damn bad militarily, and yet what do many people think when on November 9th a republic is proclaimed and two days later an armistice is signed by a guy who not only is a member of this new republic but who had opposed the war throughout? The military, favoring a broadly conservative agenda and being composed of quite a few monarchists, hoped to encourage both nationalist sentiment and a general distrust in the new government. Accordingly, the myth that Germany had been stabbed in the back by its politicians was used extensively against leftists, who found new clout in the early days of the Republic but who were trumped by a swing to the right in the polls by 1925. After the war, The myth figured heavily in the rhetoric of German nationalist groups, who, longing for the stability and prestige of the German Empire, built up a cult around military figures such as Hindenburg, elected president in 1925. However this public sentiment helped not only old conservative guards, but also encouraged the growth of a more extreme right-wing, including, you guessed it, Adolf Hitler, who would include the Jews with left-wingers in the list of \"backstabbers\". The old conservative guard and the military tried to contain Hitler and use his Nazi party to advance their own goals, and it was Hindenburg in fact, at the advice of von Papen, who appointed Hitler German Chancellor and gave him true power. \\n \"TL;DR\", The erroneous belief that Germany had not been military crushed was encouraged by a military against a nascent republic and helped later on to give power to the extreme right. \\n',\n  0),\n ...]"

For GD&T, some programs (SolidWorks) allow you to attach the symbols in the 3D view, and they are carried over into the 2D prints somehow (?), but I have always added them in manually during the 2D drafting phase, which just about every CAD software should support (or at least let you make blocks so you only have to draw them once/use other people's symbols from the internet). So try out the demos of each program and see which one best fits your needs. \\n TL;DR you can make professional prints from just about any CAD software, some are easier to use than others \\n\""
